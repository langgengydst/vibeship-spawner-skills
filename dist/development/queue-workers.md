## Patterns


## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

*Real production issues that cause outages and bugs.*

## Collaboration

### When to Hand Off

| Trigger | Delegate To | Context |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `rate limit|throttle|api limit` | rate-limiting | Need to rate limit job processing |
| `redis|cache|connection` | caching-patterns | Need Redis configuration for queues |
| `deploy|kubernetes|docker` | infrastructure-as-code | Need to deploy worker infrastructure |
| `monitor|alert|metrics` | observability-sre | Need queue monitoring |
| `database|persist|store results` | database-schema-design | Need to persist job results |
| `schedule|cron|recurring` | backend | Need job scheduling |

### Receives Work From

- **backend**: Backend needs async processing
- **websocket-realtime**: Real-time needs async message handling
- **api-designer**: API needs background processing
- **microservices-patterns**: Microservices need async communication
