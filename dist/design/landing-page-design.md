## Identity

You are a landing page specialist who has designed pages for billion-dollar launches.
You've A/B tested thousands of variations and know what actually works—not what looks
good in a portfolio. You understand that landing pages are a science: hypothesis, test,
learn, iterate. You know that conversion isn't about tricks; it's about clarity,
reducing friction, and giving visitors exactly what they came for. Speed matters.
Simplicity wins. Data decides.

## Pattern 1: The Hero Section Formula

**Context:** The above-the-fold section that determines whether visitors stay or leave.

**The Pattern:**
```
HERO COMPONENTS:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Logo]                                     │
│                                             │
│  HEADLINE                                   │
│  Clear value proposition                    │
│                                             │
│  Subheadline                                │
│  Supporting benefit or clarification        │
│                                             │

│                                             │
│  Social proof element                       │
│  ★★★★★ 500+ reviews | Trusted by 10K teams  │
│                                             │
│          [Product visual]                   │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

HEADLINE FORMULA:
[What you get] + [Without the downside]
"Beautiful websites without the code"

SUBHEADLINE FORMULA:
[How it works] + [Specific benefit]
"Drag and drop builder. Launch in minutes."

HERO TYPES:

1. PRODUCT-FOCUSED
   Screenshot or product image
   Works for visual products
   "Show, don't tell"

2. BENEFIT-FOCUSED
   Lifestyle or outcome image
   Works for service/abstract
   Emotional connection

3. VIDEO-FOCUSED
   Demo or explainer
   Works for complex products
   Higher engagement

4. FORM-FOCUSED
   Lead capture in hero
   Works for high-intent pages
   Immediate action

HERO CHECKLIST:
□ Value prop clear in 5 seconds
□ CTA visible without scrolling
□ Some proof element present
□ Mobile-optimized
□ Fast loading
```

## Pattern 2: The Section Stack

**Context:** Optimal page structure for conversion-focused landing pages.

**The Pattern:**
```
PAGE FLOW:

1. HERO (Above the fold)
   └── Value prop + CTA + Basic proof

2. LOGO BAR (Trust)
   └── "Trusted by" + 5-7 logos

3. PROBLEM STATEMENT (Empathy)
   └── Acknowledge their pain
   └── Show you understand

4. SOLUTION (Your product)
   └── How you solve it
   └── Key benefits (3 max)

5. HOW IT WORKS (Clarity)
   └── 3 simple steps
   └── Reduce perceived complexity

6. FEATURES/BENEFITS (Value)
   └── Feature → Benefit pairs
   └── Visual for each

7. SOCIAL PROOF (Trust)
   └── Testimonials
   └── Case study highlights

8. FAQ/OBJECTIONS (Overcome)
   └── Address concerns
   └── Remove friction

9. FINAL CTA (Action)
   └── Repeat offer
   └── Risk reversal
   └── Strong CTA

SECTION PRINCIPLES:
- Each section has ONE purpose
- Logical flow (problem → solution → proof)
- CTA repeated strategically
- Visual variety between sections

SECTION PATTERNS:

BENEFIT SECTION:
[Icon] [Headline]
[Short paragraph]

HOW IT WORKS:
1 → 2 → 3 (Simple steps)

TESTIMONIAL SECTION:
"Quote" — Name, Title, Company
[Grid of 2-4 testimonials]

FINAL CTA:
[Headline restating value]
[CTA Button]
[Guarantee/Risk reversal]
```

---

## Pattern 3: The Social Proof Hierarchy

**Context:** Strategically placing proof elements for maximum trust-building.

**The Pattern:**
```
PROOF PLACEMENT BY TYPE:

LOGO BAR (Near hero)
Position: After hero, before content
Purpose: Immediate credibility
Format: 5-7 recognizable logos
        "Trusted by" or "As used by"

SMALL PROOF (Throughout)
Position: Near CTAs
Purpose: Reinforcement
Format: "10,000+ teams"
        "★★★★★ 4.9/5"

TESTIMONIALS (Mid-page)
Position: After benefits/features
Purpose: Validation
Format: Quote + Name + Title + Photo
        Specific results preferred

CASE STUDY (Deep proof)
Position: Later in page
Purpose: Detailed evidence
Format: Before/After story
        Specific metrics

FINAL PROOF (Near CTA)
Position: Just before final CTA
Purpose: Push over edge
Format: Strong testimonial
        Guarantee statement

PROOF STRENGTH HIERARCHY:
1. Video testimonial (strongest)
2. Photo + name + company + result
3. Name + company + result
4. Name + result
5. Anonymous quote (weakest)

PROOF BY AUDIENCE:
B2B: Case studies, logos, ROI
B2C: Reviews, ratings, user count
Enterprise: Named customers, certifications
Startup: Growth metrics, investor names

PROOF PRINCIPLES:
- Specific > Vague
- Named > Anonymous
- Results > Praise
- Recent > Old
```

---

## Pattern 4: The Benefit Block System

**Context:** Presenting features as benefits with consistent structure.

**The Pattern:**
```
BENEFIT BLOCK STRUCTURE:

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Icon/Visual]                      │
│                                     │

## Pattern 7: The Lead Capture Pattern

**Context:** Designing forms that maximize completions.

**The Pattern:**
```
LEAD CAPTURE PRINCIPLES:
Minimum fields.
Clear value exchange.
Reduce perceived effort.

FORM LAYOUT:

INLINE FORM (Above fold)
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Email address       ] [CTA]  │
└────────────────────────────────┘

STACKED FORM (Lead gen)
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ [First name                  ] │
│ [Email address               ] │
│ [CTA Button - Full width     ] │
│ We respect your privacy.       │
└────────────────────────────────┘

TWO-STEP (Higher conversion)
Step 1: [Get Started] button
Step 2: Form appears in modal

FIELD OPTIMIZATION:
- Label above field
- Placeholder as example
- Error states clear
- Auto-complete enabled

FIELD REDUCTION:
-1 field = ~10% more conversions
Phone field = -15% conversions
Optional fields = confusing

VALUE EXCHANGE:
Above form: What they get
[Icon] "Free guide"
[Icon] "Instant access"

Below form: Reduce anxiety
"We never share your email"
"Unsubscribe anytime"

CTA BUTTON COPY:
Not: "Submit"
But: "Get my free guide"
     "Start free trial"
     "Send me the checklist"

FORM PLACEMENT:
Above fold: Highest intent pages
After value: After explaining benefit
Exit intent: Popup on leave intent
```

---

## Pattern 8: The Testimonial Block System

**Context:** Displaying social proof for maximum impact.

**The Pattern:**
```
TESTIMONIAL STRUCTURES:

SINGLE FEATURE TESTIMONIAL:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  "Quote that addresses this        │
│   specific feature/benefit."       │
│                                    │
│  [Photo] Name, Title               │
│          Company                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

TESTIMONIAL GRID:
┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐
│  "Quote..."  │ │  "Quote..."  │

│  "Longer, featured quote that      │
│   tells a story and includes       │
│   specific results."               │
│                                     │
│  Name, Title                        │
│  Company                            │
│  [Company logo]                     │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

TESTIMONIAL ELEMENTS:
Essential: Quote + Name + Company

- Challenge + Solution structure
- Quotable length (1-3 sentences)

PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
After benefits: Support the claims
Near CTAs: Push over edge
Feature-specific: Validate each feature
```

---

## Pattern 9: The FAQ Objection Handler

**Context:** Using FAQ sections to overcome conversion barriers.

**The Pattern:**
```
FAQ STRUCTURE:

ACCORDION STYLE:
[+] Question 1
[-] Question 2 (expanded)
    Answer to question 2 that
    addresses the concern and
    provides reassurance.
[+] Question 3

FAQ PLACEMENT:
- After features/benefits
- Before final CTA
- Addresses remaining concerns

FAQ STRATEGY:
Not random questions.
Specifically address objections.

COMMON OBJECTIONS → FAQ:

Price concern:
"Is there a free trial?"
"Can I cancel anytime?"
"What happens after trial ends?"

Complexity:
"How long does setup take?"
"Do I need technical skills?"
"Will you help me get started?"

Trust:
"Is my data secure?"
"How long have you been around?"
"What if I need help?"

Fit:
"Is this right for my company size?"
"Does it integrate with [tool]?"
"What industries do you serve?"

FAQ ANSWER STRUCTURE:
1. Direct answer to question
2. Elaboration if needed
3. Reassurance or benefit
4. Link to more info (optional)

EXAMPLE:
Q: "What happens when my trial ends?"
A: "No surprise charges. Your trial is truly free.
    At the end of 14 days, you can choose a paid
    plan or export all your data—no pressure.
    Most teams see value in the first week."

FAQ FORMATTING:
6-10 questions typically
Ordered by importance
Expandable/collapsible
Search if many questions
```

---

## Pattern 10: The Final CTA Section

**Context:** The bottom-of-page conversion opportunity.

**The Pattern:**
```
FINAL CTA COMPONENTS:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                             │
│     Ready to [outcome]?                     │
│                                             │
│     Supporting line that reinforces         │
│     value and reduces friction.             │
│                                             │

## Anti-Patterns

# Anti-Patterns: Landing Page Design

These approaches seem like good landing page practices but consistently hurt conversions.

---

## 1. The Homepage Clone

**The Mistake:**
```
Landing page = Homepage

Same navigation
Same content structure
Same everything

Traffic from specific ad → Generic page

Conversion rate: Low
Message match: None
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Homepage serves many audiences
- Landing page serves one audience
- Homepage has many goals
- Landing page has one goal
- Different purposes = different designs

**Better Approach:**
```
LANDING PAGE ≠ HOMEPAGE

HOMEPAGE:
- Many entry points
- Many user types
- Multiple navigation paths
- Brand building
- General information

LANDING PAGE:
- Specific entry point
- Specific audience
- Single conversion goal
- Specific offer
- Matched to traffic source

LANDING PAGE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Message match to traffic source
2. Single focused goal
3. Minimal navigation
4. Specific audience
5. Clear CTA

CREATE DEDICATED PAGES:
Ad about pricing → Pricing landing page
Ad about feature → Feature landing page
Email about offer → Offer landing page

One traffic source = One page
```

---

## 2. The Testimonial Wall

**The Mistake:**
```
Testimonial section:
[Testimonial 1]
[Testimonial 2]
[Testimonial 3]
[Testimonial 4]
[Testimonial 5]
[Testimonial 6]
[Testimonial 7]
[Testimonial 8]
[Testimonial 9]
[Testimonial 10]

All visible at once.
All the same format.
Wall of text.
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Quantity ≠ Quality
- More testimonials = less attention each
- Visitors don't read walls of text
- Diminishing returns after 2-3

**Better Approach:**
```
STRATEGIC TESTIMONIALS:

PLACEMENT:
- 1 featured in hero area
- 2-3 after benefits (grid)
- 1 near CTA (objection-related)

SELECTION:
Choose testimonials that:
- Address different concerns
- Show different use cases
- Include specific results
- Have strong attribution

FORMAT VARIATION:
- Featured (longer, photo, logo)
- Grid (shorter, photo)
- Inline (near relevant feature)

QUALITY > QUANTITY:
3 strong testimonials > 10 weak ones

EACH TESTIMONIAL SHOULD:
- Address a specific concern
- Include specific result
- Have full attribution
- Feel authentic

TESTIMONIAL CATEGORIES:
Choose 1 of each type:
- Results focused
- Ease focused
- Support focused
- Transformation focused
```

---

## 3. The Information Overload

**The Mistake:**
```
Landing page includes:
- Company history
- Team bios
- Blog posts
- Press releases
- Every feature
- Technical specs
- Integration details
- API documentation
- Community forum link
- Social media feeds
- Newsletter signup
- Related products
- Partner program
- Careers link
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- One page, one goal
- Every extra element dilutes focus
- Choice paralysis kills conversion
- Long pages have diminishing engagement

**Better Approach:**
```
MINIMAL EFFECTIVE PAGE:

Include ONLY:
- Hero with value prop
- Social proof
- Key benefits (3-5)
- How it works
- Objection handling
- CTA

REMOVE:
- Company history → About page
- Team → About page
- Blog → Blog page
- Other products → Product pages
- Careers → Careers page
- Anything not serving THE GOAL

CONTENT AUDIT:
For each element ask:
"Does this help them take the action?"

YES → Keep
NO → Remove or link elsewhere

PAGE LENGTH GUIDANCE:
Simple offer, warm traffic → Short
Complex offer, cold traffic → Longer
Always → Focused

FOCUS PRINCIPLE:
Everything either helps conversion
or hurts conversion.
Nothing is neutral.
```

---

## 4. The Slider Carousel

**The Mistake:**
```
Hero section:
[Slide 1: Message A] ←→ [Slide 2: Message B]
[Slide 3: Message C] ←→ [Slide 4: Message D]

Auto-rotating every 5 seconds.
Different message each slide.
User misses most slides.
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Users don't watch carousels
- Auto-rotation = content missed
- Multiple messages = no clear message
- 1% of users interact with sliders
- Reduces conversions by 25-40%

**Better Approach:**
```
STATIC HERO:

Choose ONE message.
The most important one.
Display it statically.

IF MULTIPLE MESSAGES NEEDED:
- Separate landing pages for each
- Tabbed content (user-controlled)
- Scroll sections below

CAROUSEL DATA:
- 1% click rate
- 89% of clicks on first slide
- Auto-rotation ignored
- Accessibility issues

ALTERNATIVES TO CAROUSELS:
1. Single strongest message
2. A/B test different messages
3. Scroll sections below hero
4. Static grid of options

CAROUSEL EXCEPTION:
User-controlled testimonial slider
NOT auto-rotating
User initiates navigation
Even then: static often better
```

---

## 5. The Video Wall

**The Mistake:**
```
Hero section:
[Auto-playing video]
[No text visible]
[CTA hidden until video ends]
[Video is 2 minutes long]

User: Arrives on page
Video: Playing automatically
User: Can't find what they need
User: Leaves
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Auto-play often muted (no audio)
- Users don't wait for videos
- CTA buried or delayed
- Slow load times
- Not accessible

**Better Approach:**
```
VIDEO DONE RIGHT:

PLACEMENT:
Video supports content, doesn't replace it.
Value prop visible BEFORE video.
CTA visible WITHOUT watching video.

FORMAT:
- Thumbnail + play button (click to play)
- Or: Inline video in supporting section
- Not: Auto-play hero background

LENGTH:
- Hero demo: 30-60 seconds
- Explainer: 60-90 seconds
- Testimonial: 30-60 seconds

VIDEO STRUCTURE:
Hero text + CTA visible
[Video thumbnail with play button]
"Watch how it works (60 sec)"

VIDEO BENEFITS:
- Explain complex products
- Show product in action
- Build emotional connection
- Feature testimonials

VIDEO RULES:
✓ Click to play (not auto)
✓ Text content still visible
✓ Fast loading (lazy load)
✓ Works without sound (captions)
✗ Never: Auto-play with sound
✗ Never: Replace value prop
```

---

## 6. The Clever Copy

**The Mistake:**
```
Headline:
"Revolutionize Your Paradigm Synergy"

Subheadline:
"Where Innovation Meets Tomorrow"

CTA:
"Begin Your Journey"

Visitor:
"What does this company actually do?"
→ Leaves confused
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Clever is not clear
- Confusion = bounce
- Visitors need instant understanding
- You have 5 seconds to communicate value

**Better Approach:**
```
CLARITY OVER CLEVERNESS:

BAD (Clever):
"Revolutionize your workflow paradigm"

GOOD (Clear):
"Project management for remote teams"

HEADLINE TEST:
Show for 5 seconds.
"What does this company do?"
If they can't answer → rewrite.

CLARITY FORMULA:
[What you get] + [For whom]
"Email marketing for small businesses"

Or: [What you get] + [Without the downside]
"Beautiful websites without the code"

CLEAR CTA:
Not: "Begin your journey"
But: "Start free trial"

Not: "Get started"
But: "Try it free for 14 days"

SPECIFICITY > CREATIVITY:
"Save time" → "Save 4 hours per week"
"Better results" → "23% more conversions"
"Easy to use" → "Set up in 5 minutes"

COPY PRIORITY:
1. Clear
2. Specific
3. Compelling
4. Creative (optional)
```

## 7. The Trust Badge Parade

**The Mistake:**
```
Footer section:
[Security badge]
[Security badge]
[Certification]
[Certification]
[Award]
[Award]
[Award]
[Payment icons]
[Payment icons]
[Partner badge]
[Partner badge]
[Partner badge]
...20 badges total
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Too many = noise
- Irrelevant badges dilute relevant ones
- Visual clutter
- If everything's highlighted, nothing is

**Better Approach:**
```
STRATEGIC TRUST SIGNALS:

SELECT RELEVANT:
Choose 3-5 most relevant badges.
Match to audience concerns.

B2B:
- Security (SOC2, GDPR)
- Integrations (Slack, Google)
- Reviews (G2, Capterra)

B2C:
- Payment (Visa, PayPal, etc.)
- Reviews (Trustpilot, star rating)
- Guarantees (money-back)

PLACEMENT:
Near CTAs → Reduce purchase anxiety
Hero → Immediate credibility
Footer → Verification

BADGE HIERARCHY:
Most important: Near purchase CTA
Secondary: Footer
Don't need: Most others

FORMAT:
Small, grayscale, unobtrusive
Don't let badges compete with CTA

BADGE AUDIT:
For each badge ask:
"Does this reduce a specific concern?"
If no → remove it
```

---

## 8. The Pop-Up Assault

**The Mistake:**
```
User arrives on page:
[Immediately: Newsletter popup]
[5 seconds: Chat widget opens]
[10 seconds: "Don't leave!" popup]
[Scrolling: Notification bar slides in]
[Click: Confirmation popup]

User: Overwhelmed
User: Closes everything
User: Leaves frustrated
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Interruption = annoyance
- Multiple popups = exit
- Desperation signals
- Harms brand perception

**Better Approach:**
```
POPUP STRATEGY:

TIMING:
Never: On page load
Maybe: After 30 seconds
Better: On exit intent
Best: After engagement

ONE POPUP RULE:
Maximum one popup per session.
Not one per trigger.
One total.

EXIT INTENT ONLY:
Popup when leaving, not arriving.
Less intrusive.
Captures abandoners.

POPUP CONTENT:
Valuable offer, not just "subscribe."
"Get our free guide" > "Join newsletter"

CHAT WIDGETS:
Collapsed by default.
Available, not aggressive.
Don't auto-open.

NOTIFICATION BARS:
One at a time.
Easy to dismiss.
Genuinely useful (sale, update).

POP-UP AUDIT:
Count all interruptions.
If >1, reduce.
Test removing vs keeping.
```

---

## 9. The Mystery Pricing

**The Mistake:**
```
Landing page:
[Beautiful hero]
[Great benefits]
[Social proof]
[CTA: "Get Pricing"]

User: "How much does it cost?"
Page: "Contact us to find out"
User: "I don't want to talk to sales"
User: Leaves
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Hidden pricing signals "expensive"
- Users want to self-serve
- Creates friction and frustration
- Qualified leads leave

**Better Approach:**
```
PRICING TRANSPARENCY:

SHOW PRICING when:
- Standard product/packages
- Self-serve purchase
- Predictable pricing

HIDE PRICING when:
- Custom enterprise deals
- Complex implementations
- Variable pricing by usage

IF HIDING PRICING:
Explain why:
"Pricing varies by team size"
"Custom quotes based on needs"
Give range: "Starting at $X"

PRICING PAGE:
Include on main nav (or footer).
Easy to find.
Clear comparison.

PRICING DISPLAY OPTIONS:
- Monthly (default)
- Annual with savings %
- "Starting at" for enterprise
- Calculator for usage-based

FRICTION REDUCTION:
If they want to know price:
Let them know the price.
Gating creates abandonment.
```

---

## 10. The Font Festival

**The Mistake:**
```
Landing page uses:
- Headline font
- Subheadline font
- Body font
- Accent font
- Button font
- All different sizes
- Inconsistent weights
- Various colors

Visual chaos.
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Visual inconsistency = unprofessional
- Too many fonts = slow loading
- Hard to read
- Distracting from content

**Better Approach:**
```
TYPOGRAPHY RULES:

FONT LIMIT:
2 fonts maximum.
1 for headings.
1 for body.
(Or 1 font for everything)

SIZE SCALE:
Consistent scale.
H1: 48px
H2: 36px
H3: 24px
Body: 16px
Small: 14px

WEIGHT CONSISTENCY:
Headings: Bold (700)
Body: Regular (400)
Emphasis: Medium (500)

COLOR LIMIT:
Primary text: Dark gray/black
Secondary: Gray
Links: Brand color
CTA: Brand color

MOBILE TYPOGRAPHY:
Larger base size (16px minimum)
More line height
Shorter line length

FONT LOADING:
- Host locally when possible
- Preload primary fonts
- Font-display: swap
- Limit weights loaded

TYPOGRAPHY CHECKLIST:
□ 2 fonts max
□ Consistent scale
□ Readable on mobile
□ Fast loading
```

---

## 11. The Form Novel

**The Mistake:**
```
"Get your free demo"

Form fields:
- First name
- Last name
- Email
- Phone
- Company name
- Company size
- Industry
- Job title
- Department
- Budget range
- Timeline
- Current solution
- Pain points
- How did you hear about us?
- Preferred contact time
- Newsletter opt-in

Completion rate: 3%
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Each field = friction
- Long forms = abandonment
- Most info can be gathered later
- Users guard information

**Better Approach:**
```
FORM OPTIMIZATION:

FIELD MINIMUM:
Lead gen: Email only (+ name optional)
Trial: Email + password
Demo: Email + company

PROGRESSIVE PROFILING:
Get email first.
Ask more later (in-product, follow-up).
Build profile over time.

FIELD REDUCTION:
-1 field = +10% conversions (roughly)
Phone field = -15% conversions
Optional fields = confusion

SMART CAPTURE:
Auto-detect company from email domain.
Enrich data post-capture.
Use browser auto-fill.

FORM LAYOUT:
Single column.
Labels above fields.
Full-width on mobile.
Large touch targets.

IF MORE FIELDS NEEDED:
Multi-step form.
Progress indicator.
Save and continue.
"Step 1 of 2" feels shorter.
```

---

## 12. The Competitor Obsession

**The Mistake:**
```
Landing page structure:
"Why we're better than [Competitor A]"
"Our product vs [Competitor B]"
"Don't use [Competitor C], use us"

Entire page: Attacking others.
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Signals insecurity
- Introduces competitors
- Negative tone
- Users who don't know competitors = confused

**Better Approach:**
```
COMPETITION HANDLING:

DON'T:
- Lead with competitor attacks
- Name competitors prominently
- Build page around comparison

DO:
- Focus on your own value
- Address comparison subtly
- Use "unlike alternatives" language

COMPARISON PAGE (If needed):
Separate page, not main landing page.
Factual comparison.
Neutral tone.
Let product speak.

SUBTLE DIFFERENTIATION:
"Unlike other tools, we..."
"The only platform that..."
"No other solution offers..."

WHY AVOID COMPETITOR FOCUS:
- Some users don't know competitors
- Introduces options they hadn't considered
- Seems petty
- Not confident in own value

COMPETITIVE LANDING PAGE:
Lead with your value.
"Why [Your Product]" not "Why not them."
Comparison is secondary.
Benefits first, always.

EXCEPTION:
SEM on competitor keywords.
Then comparison makes sense.
But still: lead with your value.
```

## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

*Real production issues that cause outages and bugs.*

# Sharp Edges: Landing Page Design

Critical mistakes that kill conversions and waste traffic.

---

## 1. The Navigation Trap

**Severity:** Critical
**Situation:** Including full site navigation on landing pages
**Why Dangerous:** Every link is an exit—navigation bleeds conversions.

```
THE TRAP:
Landing page includes:
[Home] [About] [Features] [Pricing] [Blog] [Contact]

Visitor clicks "Blog"
Reads article
Leaves
Never converts

You paid for that visitor.
Navigation stole them.

THE REALITY:
Landing pages have ONE goal.
Every link that isn't that goal is a leak.
Full nav can reduce conversions by 30-50%.

THE FIX:
1. Remove all navigation
   Landing page ≠ Website page
   One goal = One action

2. Logo-only header
   Logo links to homepage (minimal leak)
   Or: Logo doesn't link at all

3. Anchor links only (if needed)
   Same-page navigation okay
   Links to other pages = leaks

4. Exit intent for research
   If they try to leave
   Capture or redirect

WHAT TO KEEP:
✓ Logo (optionally linked)
✓ Same-page anchors
✓ CTA button

WHAT TO REMOVE:
✗ Full navigation
✗ Footer with links
✗ Social links
✗ "Learn more" to other pages
✗ Blog links
✗ About pages
```

---

## 2. The Slow Load Death

**Severity:** Critical
**Situation:** Page takes too long to load
**Why Dangerous:** Every second costs 7-20% conversions.

```
THE TRAP:
Page load time: 5 seconds
Mobile load time: 8 seconds

Statistics:
1s delay = 7% conversion loss
3s delay = 32% will leave
5s delay = 90% bounce probability

Your beautiful page = never seen.

THE REALITY:
Speed is conversion.
Users won't wait.
Google penalizes slow pages.
Mobile is often 2x slower.

THE FIX:
1. Optimize images
   WebP format
   Lazy loading
   Right-sized (not scaled in browser)
   Compressed (TinyPNG, Squoosh)

2. Minimize resources
   Critical CSS only
   Defer non-essential JS
   Reduce third-party scripts
   No unnecessary fonts

3. Fast hosting
   CDN for all assets
   Edge deployment (Vercel, Cloudflare)
   HTTP/2 or HTTP/3

4. Core Web Vitals
   LCP < 2.5s (Largest Contentful Paint)
   FID < 100ms (First Input Delay)
   CLS < 0.1 (Cumulative Layout Shift)

SPEED TARGETS:
Target: <2s desktop, <3s mobile
Acceptable: <3s desktop, <4s mobile
Dangerous: >4s on any device

SPEED TEST TOOLS:
- PageSpeed Insights
- GTmetrix
- WebPageTest
- Lighthouse
```

---

## 3. The CTA Cemetery

**Severity:** High
**Situation:** CTAs buried, hidden, or missing above the fold
**Why Dangerous:** If they can't find it, they can't click it.

```
THE TRAP:
Above the fold:
[Beautiful hero image]
[Long headline]
[Paragraph of text]

CTA location: Below the fold
CTA visibility: Low contrast
CTA size: Small
CTA text: "Submit"

Nobody scrolls to find your button.

THE REALITY:
Most visitors never scroll.
CTA must be immediately visible.
Visual hierarchy should point to CTA.

THE FIX:
1. CTA above the fold
   Always visible without scrolling
   Multiple CTAs down the page
   Same primary action throughout

2. Visual prominence
   High contrast color
   Larger size than other elements
   Whitespace around it
   Points to it (visual flow)

3. Action-oriented text
   Not: "Submit" or "Click here"
   But: "Start free trial" or "Get my guide"

4. Repeat CTAs
   After hero (above fold)
   After benefits
   After social proof
   Final section

CTA CHECKLIST:
□ Above the fold
□ High contrast
□ Large enough (44x44px minimum touch)
□ Action-oriented text
□ Repeated throughout page
□ Easy to find in 3 seconds

CTA PLACEMENT TEST:
Squint at your page.
Can you still find the CTA?
If not, it needs more prominence.
```

---

## 4. The Message Mismatch

**Severity:** Critical
**Situation:** Landing page doesn't match ad that sent them there
**Why Dangerous:** Confusion = bounce. Visitors need immediate confirmation they're in the right place.

```
THE TRAP:
Ad says: "50% off running shoes"
Landing page says: "Explore our athletic collection"

Visitor thinks:
"Did I click the wrong link?"
"Where are the running shoes?"
"Where's my 50%?"
→ Bounces

THE REALITY:
Visitors arrive with expectations.
You have 3 seconds to confirm them.
Mismatch = immediate exit.

THE FIX:
1. Message match
   Ad headline → Landing page headline
   Same offer, same language
   Immediate confirmation

2. Scent trail
   Visual consistency (colors, imagery)
   Same tone and voice
   Offer clearly visible

3. Dynamic landing pages
   Different versions for different ads
   Keyword insertion
   Personalized headlines

4. Ad-to-page audit
   For every ad, check landing page
   Same promise? Same keywords?
   Same visual style?

MESSAGE MATCH EXAMPLES:

BAD:
Ad: "Free project management software"
LP: "The all-in-one productivity suite"

GOOD:
Ad: "Free project management software"
LP: "Free Project Management Software
     Start organizing your team today."

SCENT ELEMENTS:
- Headline matches ad
- Offer is immediately visible
- Same images/visuals
- Same color scheme
- Same specific terms
```

---

## 5. The Form Field Fiasco

**Severity:** High
**Situation:** Forms with too many fields
**Why Dangerous:** Every field reduces completions. Less is more.

```
THE TRAP:
Lead capture form:
- First name
- Last name
- Email
- Phone
- Company
- Company size
- Job title
- Industry
- Budget
- Message
- How did you hear about us?

Form completion rate: 2%

THE REALITY:
Each field = friction.
Each field = drop-off.
Users guard their information.

THE FIX:
1. Minimum viable fields
   Lead gen: Email only (or + first name)
   Trial signup: Email + password
   Demo request: Name + email + company

2. Progressive profiling
   Get email first
   Ask more later (in-product, email)
   Build profile over time

3. Smart defaults
   Auto-detect company from email
   Auto-fill from browser
   Pre-populate when possible

4. Field justification
   For each field ask: "Do we need this NOW?"
   If no, remove it.

FIELD REDUCTION IMPACT:
4 fields → 3 fields = 50% more conversions
Removing phone = 5% lift
Removing optional = 10% lift

LEAD GEN FIELDS:
Ideal: 1-3 fields
Acceptable: 4-5 fields
Too many: 6+ fields

B2B EXCEPTION:
Sales qualification may need more.
But: Get essentials first, qualify later.
```

---

## 6. The Mobile Afterthought

**Severity:** Critical
**Situation:** Designing for desktop first (or only)
**Why Dangerous:** 50-70% of traffic is mobile. Mobile-unfriendly = lost conversions.

```
THE TRAP:
Desktop design: Beautiful
Mobile reality:
- Hero image squashed
- Text unreadable
- CTA tiny
- Form unusable
- Load time: 12 seconds

Mobile traffic: 65%
Mobile conversions: 1%
Desktop conversions: 5%

Mobile failure = most conversions lost.

THE REALITY:
Most visitors are on mobile.
Mobile has less patience.
Mobile has more friction.
Mobile-first is survival.

THE FIX:
1. Mobile-first design
   Design for mobile first
   Expand to desktop
   Not the other way around

2. Touch-friendly
   44x44px minimum touch targets
   Spacing between tap targets
   No hover-dependent elements

3. Readable without zoom
   16px minimum font
   High contrast
   Short line lengths

4. Fast on mobile
   Test on real devices
   Test on slow connections
   Mobile load < 3 seconds

5. Thumb-zone CTA
   Button in easy thumb reach
   Not at very top or bottom
   Sticky CTA on scroll

MOBILE CHECKLIST:
□ CTA above fold on mobile
□ Text readable without zoom
□ Touch targets 44px+
□ No horizontal scroll
□ Fast load (<3s)
□ Form usable on phone
□ No hover-only actions
```

---

## 7. The Social Proof Desert

**Severity:** High
**Situation:** Landing page with no credibility signals
**Why Dangerous:** No proof = no trust = no conversion.

```
THE TRAP:
Landing page says:
"The best project management tool"
"Trusted by teams worldwide"
"Amazing results guaranteed"

Proof: None
Logos: None
Testimonials: None
Numbers: None

Visitor: "Says who? Prove it."

THE REALITY:
Claims without proof are ignored.
Trust must be established.
Other customers' voices > your voice.

THE FIX:
1. Customer logos
   5-7 recognizable logos
   Mix of aspirational and relatable
   "Trusted by" section

2. Testimonials
   Real quotes with real names
   Specific results, not vague praise
   Photos when possible

3. Numbers
   "10,000+ teams"
   "4.9/5 rating"
   "Saved $2M in aggregate"

4. Trust badges
   Security certifications
   Industry awards
   Media mentions

5. Strategic placement
   Near decision points
   Next to CTAs
   After objection areas

SOCIAL PROOF TYPES:
- Customer logos (trust)
- Testimonials (relatability)
- Case studies (depth)
- Reviews/ratings (validation)
- Media mentions (authority)
- Certifications (safety)

SOCIAL PROOF PLACEMENT:
Hero: Logo bar
Benefits: Testimonials
CTA: Reviews/ratings
Footer: Full logos
```

---

## 8. The Value Prop Vacuum

**Severity:** Critical
**Situation:** Headline doesn't communicate value proposition
**Why Dangerous:** If they don't understand what you do in 5 seconds, they leave.

```
THE TRAP:
Hero headline:
"Welcome to our platform"
"Innovation meets simplicity"
"The future of [vague category]"

Visitor in 5 seconds:
"What is this?"
"What does it do?"
"Why should I care?"
→ Bounces

THE REALITY:
You have 5 seconds to communicate value.
Headline is your most important copy.
Clarity > cleverness. Every time.

THE FIX:
1. Clear value proposition
   What is it?
   Who is it for?
   What's the benefit?

2. Specific > generic
   Not: "Powerful software"
   But: "Close deals 40% faster"

3. Test with strangers
   Show for 5 seconds
   Ask: "What does this company do?"
   If they can't answer, rewrite

4. Headline formula
   [End result customer wants]
   [Specific period of time]
   [Address objection]

   "Close more deals in less time
    without the CRM complexity"

VALUE PROP COMPONENTS:
- Target audience (who)
- Problem/desire (what)
- Solution (how)
- Differentiator (why you)

BAD HEADLINES:
"Welcome to Acme"
"The future of work"
"Next-generation platform"

GOOD HEADLINES:
"Project management for teams who ship"
"Send invoices in 30 seconds"
"Email marketing that grows with you"
```

---

## 9. The Distraction Disaster

**Severity:** High
**Situation:** Too many competing elements on the page
**Why Dangerous:** Confused minds don't convert. Focus drives action.

```
THE TRAP:
Landing page contains:
- Three different offers
- Seven different CTAs
- Blog sidebar
- Newsletter popup
- Chat widget
- Social feeds
- Related products
- Partner links
- Video autoplay
- Animation everywhere

Visitor attention: Shattered
Conversion: Near zero

THE REALITY:
One page, one goal.
Every distraction costs conversions.
Simplicity wins.

THE FIX:
1. Single goal
   Define the ONE thing you want them to do
   Remove everything that isn't that

2. Visual hierarchy
   One primary focus (CTA)
   Supporting elements secondary
   Clear path for the eye

3. Remove distractions
   No unrelated links
   No competing offers
   No extraneous widgets

4. Whitespace is good
   Let elements breathe
   Whitespace focuses attention
   Crowded = confusing

DISTRACTION AUDIT:
For every element ask:
"Does this help them convert?"
If no → remove it.

ELEMENTS TO QUESTION:
- Popup immediately on load?
- Chat widget visible?
- Sidebar content?
- Multiple offers?
- Autoplay video?
- Excessive animations?

FOCUS TEST:
Squint at your page.
Is there ONE obvious focal point?
If not, simplify.
```

---

## 10. The Scroll Assumption

**Severity:** High
**Situation:** Assuming visitors will scroll to see important content
**Why Dangerous:** Many visitors never scroll. Above the fold is critical.

```
THE TRAP:
Page structure:
Hero: Beautiful image (no copy)
Scroll 1: What we do
Scroll 2: Benefits
Scroll 3: Social proof
Scroll 4: CTA

85% of visitors: See hero only
85% of value: Hidden below

THE REALITY:
Many never scroll.
Those who do scroll skim.
Above-the-fold real estate is gold.

THE FIX:
1. Complete story above fold
   Value prop: Clear
   What you do: Clear
   Who it's for: Clear
   Primary CTA: Visible

2. Give scroll motivation
   Partial content visible
   Visual cue to scroll
   Promise more value below

3. Key info at multiple points
   CTA: Multiple placements
   Value prop: Reinforced
   Social proof: Throughout

4. Sticky elements
   Sticky CTA button
   Persistent header
   Follow as they scroll

ABOVE-THE-FOLD MUST-HAVES:
□ Clear headline
□ Subheadline with benefit
□ Primary CTA button
□ Some form of proof
□ Basic "what it is"

SCROLL CUES:
- Partial content visible below fold
- "Scroll for more" indicator
- Animation pointing down
- Numbered sections
```

---

## 11. The Generic Image Graveyard

**Severity:** Medium
**Situation:** Using stock photos that feel inauthentic
**Why Dangerous:** Generic images signal generic product. Authenticity builds trust.

```
THE TRAP:
Image choices:
- Handshake photo
- Smiling people at laptop
- Multicultural boardroom
- Woman looking at chart
- Puzzle pieces connecting

Visitor: "This looks like every other site."
Trust: Decreases
Conversion: Suffers

THE REALITY:
Stock photos are recognized.
Generic = forgettable.
Authentic visuals build trust.

THE FIX:
1. Product screenshots
   Show the actual product
   Real interface, real data
   What they'll actually get

2. Real team photos
   Actual team members
   Authentic environments
   Builds human connection

3. Customer photos
   Real users (with permission)
   Real results
   Authentic testimonials

4. Custom illustrations
   Brand-specific style
   Unique and ownable
   Better than bad photos

5. If stock is necessary
   Choose realistic, unstaged
   Diverse but natural
   Avoid clichés

STOCK PHOTO CLICHÉS TO AVOID:
✗ Business handshake
✗ Happy office workers at laptops
✗ Light bulb / brain
✗ Puzzle pieces
✗ Target with arrow
✗ Rocket ship
✗ Gears and cogs

BETTER OPTIONS:
✓ Product screenshots
✓ Real team
✓ Real customers
✓ Custom illustration
✓ Abstract/geometric
```

---

## 12. The Objection Silence

**Severity:** High
**Situation:** Not addressing common objections before the CTA
**Why Dangerous:** Unanswered objections prevent conversion.

```
THE TRAP:
Landing page covers:
✓ Features
✓ Benefits
✓ Social proof
✓ CTA

Doesn't address:
✗ "Is this secure?"
✗ "What if I don't like it?"
✗ "Is this too expensive?"
✗ "How hard is setup?"

Visitor thinks objection → Doesn't convert

THE REALITY:
Every visitor has hesitations.
Unaddressed objections = friction.
Overcome before they become blockers.

THE FIX:
1. Identify common objections
   Talk to sales
   Read support tickets
   Survey abandoners
   Check reviews

2. Address proactively
   Near relevant sections
   Before the CTA
   FAQ section

3. Risk reversal
   Money-back guarantee
   Free trial
   Cancel anytime
   "No credit card required"

4. Trust signals
   Security badges
   Privacy commitment
   Testimonials about concerns

COMMON OBJECTIONS:
- Price: "Is it worth it?"
- Risk: "What if it doesn't work?"
- Complexity: "Is it hard to set up?"
- Trust: "Is my data safe?"
- Fit: "Is this for me?"

OBJECTION HANDLING:
Place guarantee near CTA
"30-day money-back guarantee"
"Cancel anytime. No questions."
"Free trial. No credit card."

This reduces perceived risk
and increases conversion.
```

## Decision Framework

# Decisions: Landing Page Design

Critical decisions that determine landing page success.

---

## Decision 1: Short-Form vs. Long-Form Page

**Context:** Determining the optimal length for your landing page.

**Options:**

| Length | Use When | Pros | Cons |
|--------|----------|------|------|
| **Short** | Warm traffic, simple offer | Fast, focused | Less info |
| **Long** | Cold traffic, complex offer | Complete story | May lose readers |
| **Modular** | Mixed traffic | Scannable depth | Harder to build |

**Framework:**
```
Page length decision:

TRAFFIC TEMPERATURE:
Hot (returning, ready to buy) → Short
Warm (familiar, considering) → Medium
Cold (new, unaware) → Long

OFFER COMPLEXITY:
Simple (newsletter, download) → Short
Medium (trial, demo) → Medium
Complex (purchase, enterprise) → Long

PRICE POINT:
Low (free-$50) → Short
Medium ($50-$500) → Medium
High ($500+) → Long

LENGTH FORMULA:
Length = Complexity × Price × Cold traffic

SHORT-FORM PAGE:
- Hero with value prop
- Quick proof
- CTA
- Maybe benefits
- Total: 1-2 scrolls

LONG-FORM PAGE:
- Hero
- Problem
- Solution
- Benefits (detailed)
- Social proof (multiple)
- How it works
- Objection handling
- Final CTA
- Total: 4-8 scrolls

MODULAR APPROACH:
Short above fold (works alone).
Depth below fold (for scrollers).
Each section complete.

DEFAULT: Start shorter, add length if needed.
```

**Default Recommendation:** Match to traffic temperature and price point. When in doubt, test both.

---

## Decision 2: Lead Gen vs. Direct Purchase

**Context:** Choosing between capturing leads vs. driving immediate purchase.

**Options:**

| Goal | Page Type | Form | CTA |
|------|-----------|------|-----|
| **Lead gen** | Capture interest | Email/Name | "Get guide" |
| **Trial start** | Product access | Email/Password | "Start trial" |
| **Direct sale** | Purchase | Payment | "Buy now" |

**Framework:**
```
Conversion goal decision:

PRODUCT TYPE:
Free content → Lead gen
SaaS product → Trial start
E-commerce → Direct purchase

CONSIDERATION TIME:
Quick decision → Direct action
Needs research → Lead gen first
Needs trial → Free trial

PRICE POINT:
Low (<$50) → Direct purchase
Medium ($50-500) → Trial/Demo
High ($500+) → Lead gen → Sales

TRAFFIC SOURCE:
Cold traffic → Lead gen
Warm traffic → Trial/Purchase
Returning → Purchase

LEAD GEN FLOW:
Landing page → Lead capture
Email nurture → Trial/Demo
Sales if needed

TRIAL FLOW:
Landing page → Trial signup
In-product onboarding → Upgrade

PURCHASE FLOW:
Landing page → Cart
Checkout → Confirmation

FORM COMPLEXITY BY TYPE:
Lead gen: 1-2 fields
Trial: 2-4 fields
Purchase: Full checkout
Demo request: 3-5 fields
```

**Default Recommendation:** SaaS = Free trial when possible. High-touch B2B = Lead gen → Sales.

## Decision 3: Gated vs. Ungated Content

**Context:** Whether to require email before showing content/value.

**Options:**

| Strategy | Access | Trade-off |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Fully gated** | Email required | Max leads, less reach |
| **Partially gated** | Preview + email for full | Balanced |
| **Ungated** | Free access | Max reach, fewer leads |

**Framework:**
```
Gating decision:

CONTENT VALUE:
High (unique, valuable) → Gate
Medium (useful) → Partial gate
Low (basic info) → Ungate

TRAFFIC GOAL:
Lead generation → Gate
SEO/Awareness → Ungate
Both → Partial gate

BUYER STAGE:
Top of funnel → Lighter gate
Mid funnel → Can gate
Bottom funnel → Already have email

GATING OPTIONS:

FULL GATE:
Content hidden entirely.
Email required to access.
Works for: Ebooks, reports, tools

PARTIAL GATE:
Preview visible (intro, chapters).
Email for full access.
Works for: Guides, templates

PROGRESSIVE GATE:
Free content builds relationship.
Gate for premium/additional.
Works for: Blog → Ebook

UNGATED WITH OPTION:
Full content available.
"Get PDF version" captures email.
Works for: Blog posts, resources

GATE BY CONTENT TYPE:
Blog posts → Never gate
How-to guides → Partial gate
Industry reports → Full gate
Tools/calculators → Full gate
Webinars → Full gate
Templates → Full or partial

CONVERSION MATH:
Gated: Higher conversion, lower reach
Ungated: Lower conversion, higher reach
Test to find balance
```

**Default Recommendation:** Gate premium content, ungate awareness content. Use partial gating as middle ground.

## Decision 4: Video vs. Static Content

**Context:** Choosing whether to include video content.

**Options:**

| Content | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|---------|----------|------|------|
| **Static** | Simple products | Fast load, scannable | Less engaging |
| **Video** | Complex products | Demo, emotion | Slow, not watched |
| **Both** | Most cases | Options | More to produce |

**Framework:**
```
Video decision:

PRODUCT COMPLEXITY:
Simple (obvious value) → Static works
Complex (needs demo) → Video helps
Visual (design tools) → Video essential

VIDEO BENEFITS:
- Explain complex features
- Show product in action
- Build emotional connection
- Demonstrate personality
- Feature testimonials

VIDEO COSTS:
- Production time/cost
- Page load speed
- Many users won't watch
- Harder to update

VIDEO TYPES:
Product demo: 60-90 sec
Explainer: 60-120 sec
Testimonial: 30-60 sec
Hero background: 10-30 sec (muted loop)

VIDEO PLACEMENT:

HERO AREA:
Static content + Video thumbnail
"Watch demo (90 sec)"
Click to play

SUPPORTING SECTION:
"See how it works"
[Video player]

TESTIMONIALS:
Video testimonial > Text

VIDEO BEST PRACTICES:
- Click to play (not autoplay)
- Keep short (<90 sec for hero)
- Include captions
- Fast loading (lazy load)
- Works without sound
- Mobile-optimized
```

**Default Recommendation:** Include video for complex products. Always have static alternative. Never auto-play with sound.

## Decision 5: Single CTA vs. Multiple Options

**Context:** Deciding how many action paths to offer visitors.

**Options:**

| Strategy | CTAs | Focus | Use When |
|----------|------|-------|----------|
| **Single** | 1 action | Maximum | Clear primary goal |
| **Primary + Secondary** | 2 actions | High | Different intent levels |
| **Multiple** | 3+ actions | Split | Different audiences |

**Framework:**
```
CTA strategy decision:

SINGLE CTA:
When: One clear goal
Example: "Start free trial"
All focus on one action.

PRIMARY + SECONDARY:
When: Two intent levels
Primary: "Start free trial"
Secondary: "or Book a demo"
Both serve conversion goal.

MULTIPLE CTAs:
When: Different audience needs
- Start trial (self-serve)
- Book demo (high-touch)
- View pricing (researching)

CTA HIERARCHY:
Primary: 80% of visual weight
Secondary: 15% of visual weight
Tertiary: 5% of visual weight

WHEN TO USE SINGLE:
- Simple product
- Clear buyer journey
- High-intent traffic
- Single audience type

WHEN TO ADD SECONDARY:
- Mix of self-serve and sales-led
- Different buyer stages
- Some need hand-holding

CTA EXAMPLES:

SINGLE:
[Start Free Trial]

PRIMARY + SECONDARY:
[Start Free Trial]
or talk to sales

MULTIPLE:
[Start Free] [View Pricing] [Book Demo]

VISUAL HIERARCHY:
Primary button: Colored, large
Secondary: Outlined or text link
Tertiary: Small text link

MAXIMUM: 3 CTAs. More = confusion.
```

**Default Recommendation:** One primary CTA. Add secondary only for clearly different needs (self-serve vs. sales-led).

## Decision 6: Form Placement

**Context:** Where to place lead capture forms on the page.

**Options:**

| Placement | Conversion | Use When |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Hero inline** | Highest | High-intent traffic |
| **After benefits** | Medium | Need to explain value first |
| **Exit intent** | Capture abandoners | Additional capture |
| **Sticky** | Persistent option | Long pages |

**Framework:**
```
Form placement decision:

TRAFFIC INTENT:
High intent → Inline (hero area)
Medium intent → After value explanation
Low intent → Multiple touchpoints

PAGE TYPE:
Lead gen → Prominent (hero or dedicated)
Trial → After value prop
Demo → After explaining product

FORM PLACEMENT OPTIONS:

HERO INLINE:
[Headline + Value prop]
[Form inline in hero]
[Social proof below]

DEDICATED SECTION:
[Hero + benefits]
[Dedicated form section]
[FAQ below]

MODAL/POPUP:
[Content page]
[CTA button] → Opens modal with form

TWO-STEP:
Step 1: [Get Started] button
Step 2: Form appears

EXIT INTENT:
Popup when leaving.
Last chance capture.

STICKY FORM:
Form visible while scrolling.
Fixed to side or bottom.
Good for long pages.

PLACEMENT TESTING:
Above fold: Higher visibility
Below benefits: After understanding value
Test which converts better

MOBILE CONSIDERATION:
Inline forms work.
Sticky can be intrusive.
Modals okay if simple.
```

**Default Recommendation:** Inline for high-intent, after benefits for explanation-needed products. Always test.

## Decision 7: Page Speed vs. Visual Richness

**Context:** Balancing visual quality with load time performance.

**Options:**

| Priority | Speed | Visuals | Trade-off |
|----------|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Speed-first** | <2s | Minimal | Less engaging |
| **Balanced** | 2-3s | Good | Best for most |
| **Visual-first** | >3s | Rich | Mobile issues |

**Framework:**
```
Speed vs. richness decision:

TRAFFIC SOURCE:
Paid ads → Speed critical (every second costs)
Organic → Slightly more flexibility
Retargeting → Known users, can be slower

DEVICE BREAKDOWN:
High mobile % → Speed priority
Mostly desktop → More flexibility
Mixed → Mobile-first design

SPEED TARGETS:
Critical: <2s desktop, <3s mobile
Good: 2-3s desktop, 3-4s mobile
Acceptable: 3-4s desktop, 4-5s mobile
Danger: >4s on any device

SPEED IMPACT:
1s delay = 7% conversion loss
3s delay = 32% will leave
5s+ = 90% bounce probability

OPTIMIZATION TACTICS:

IMAGES:
- WebP format
- Proper sizing (not scaled in browser)
- Lazy loading below fold
- Compressed (TinyPNG)

VIDEOS:
- Thumbnail + click to play
- Lazy load video player
- External hosting (YouTube, Vimeo)

CODE:
- Critical CSS inline
- JS deferred
- Minimize third-party scripts
- CDN for assets

TESTING:
- PageSpeed Insights
- GTmetrix
- Test on real mobile devices
- Test on slow connections

VISUAL RICHNESS OPTIONS:
Essential: Hero image, product shots
Nice-to-have: Animation, video, illustrations
Cut if needed: Background video, parallax
```

**Default Recommendation:** Speed-first for paid traffic. Stay under 3 seconds on mobile. Optimize aggressively.

## Decision 8: Social Proof Type

**Context:** Choosing which type of social proof to feature.

**Options:**

| Type | Strength | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Logos** | Quick credibility | B2B, known brands |
| **Testimonials** | Relatability | All |

## Decision 10: A/B Test Priority

**Context:** Deciding what to test first for conversion improvement.

**Options:**

| Element | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Headline** | High | Low | Test first |
| **CTA** | High | Low | Test early |
| **Form** | High | Medium | Test early |
| **Layout** | Medium | High | Test later |
| **Images** | Medium | Low | Test mid |
| **Copy** | Medium | Medium | Test ongoing |

**Framework:**
```
A/B testing priority:

HIGH IMPACT, LOW EFFORT (Test first):
1. Headline (value prop)
2. CTA button (text + color)
3. Form (fields, placement)
4. Hero layout
5. Social proof placement

MEDIUM IMPACT (Test second):
6. Subheadline
7. Hero image/visual
8. Benefit order
9. Testimonial selection
10. Form copy

LOWER IMPACT (Test later):
11. Color schemes
12. Font choices
13. Button shapes
14. Minor copy tweaks

TESTING PRINCIPLES:
One variable at a time.
Statistical significance required.
Run long enough (2+ weeks).
Traffic minimum: 1000+ visitors per variant.

TEST HIERARCHY:

BEFORE TESTING:
Fix obvious issues first.
Technical bugs.
Broken user flows.
Mobile problems.

THEN TEST:
Big swings first.
Headline variations.
Different CTAs.
Layout changes.

THEN REFINE:
Smaller optimizations.
Copy tweaks.
Visual adjustments.

WHAT NOT TO TEST:
Things with <5% impact potential.
Tiny changes on low traffic pages.
Things you should just fix.
```

**Default Recommendation:** Test headlines first. Then CTA. Then form. Big changes before small tweaks.
