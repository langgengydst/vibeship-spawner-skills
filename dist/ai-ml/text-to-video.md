## Patterns

### Text-to-Video with Replicate
Generate videos from text prompts using Replicate models.

Model recommendations:
- Wan 2.2: Open-source, fast, good quality
- Kling 2.1: High quality, character consistency
- minimax/hailuo: Physics realism

Videos typically take 30-150 seconds to generate.


### Image-to-Video Animation
Animate still images into videos.
Preserve image content while adding motion.

Best for:
- Product animations
- Character motion
- Scene transitions
- Social media content


### Video Prompting Best Practices
Write effective prompts for video generation.
Key elements: subject, action, camera, lighting, style.

Video prompts differ from image prompts:
- Emphasize motion and action
- Describe camera movement
- Specify timing and pacing


### Runway Gen-3 API Integration
Integrate Runway's Gen-3 Alpha for professional video.
Features: 4K resolution, camera controls, lip sync.

Note: Requires Runway API access (paid).
Credits: ~10 credits/second for Gen-3 Alpha.


### Luma Dream Machine Integration
Integrate Luma's Dream Machine for cinematic video.
Features: HDR output, keyframes, character reference.

Ray3: Latest model with studio-grade HDR.
Draft Mode: Fast exploration before final render.


### Video Processing Pipeline
Build end-to-end video generation pipelines.
Handle upload, generation, post-processing, delivery.

Components:
- Input validation
- Queue management
- Progress tracking
- Error handling
