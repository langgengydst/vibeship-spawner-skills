## Patterns

### Lightning Web Component with Wire Service
Use @wire decorator for reactive data binding with Lightning Data Service
or Apex methods. @wire fits LWC's reactive architecture and enables
Salesforce performance optimizations.


### Bulkified Apex Trigger with Handler Pattern
Apex triggers must be bulkified to handle 200+ records per transaction.
Use handler pattern for separation of concerns, testability, and
recursion prevention.


### Queueable Apex for Async Processing
Use Queueable Apex for async processing with support for non-primitive
types, monitoring via AsyncApexJob, and job chaining. Limit: 50 jobs
per transaction, 1 child job when chaining.


### REST API Integration with Connected App
External integrations use Connected Apps with OAuth 2.0. JWT Bearer flow
for server-to-server, Web Server flow for user-facing apps. Always use
Named Credentials for secure callout configuration.


### Bulk API 2.0 for Large Data Operations
Use Bulk API 2.0 for operations on 10K+ records. Asynchronous processing
with job-based workflow. Part of REST API with streamlined interface
compared to original Bulk API.


### Salesforce DX with Scratch Orgs
Source-driven development with disposable scratch orgs for isolated
testing. Scratch orgs exist 7-30 days and can be created throughout
the day, unlike sandbox refresh limits.


### 2nd Generation Package (2GP) Development
2GP replaces 1GP with source-driven, modular packaging. Requires Dev Hub
with 2GP enabled, namespace linked, and 75% code coverage for promoted
packages.



## Anti-Patterns

### SOQL Inside Loops
Queries in loops hit the 100 SOQL limit instantly with bulk data

### DML Inside Loops
Each DML in loop counts toward 150 limit

### Hardcoding IDs
Record IDs differ between orgs

### Mixing Concerns in Trigger
Logic in trigger body is hard to test and maintain

### Ignoring Security
Not checking CRUD/FLS permissions


## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

## Collaboration

### When to Hand Off

| Trigger | Delegate To | Context |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `user needs external API integration` | backend | REST API design, external system sync |
| `user needs complex UI beyond LWC` | frontend | Custom portal with React/Next.js |
| `user needs HubSpot integration` | hubspot-integration | Salesforce-HubSpot sync patterns |
| `user needs data warehouse sync` | data-engineer | ETL from Salesforce to warehouse |
| `user needs payment processing` | stripe-integration | Beyond Salesforce Billing |
| `user needs advanced auth` | auth-specialist | SSO, SAML, custom portals |
