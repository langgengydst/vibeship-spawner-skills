## Patterns

### Link Token Creation and Exchange
Create a link_token for Plaid Link, exchange public_token for access_token.
Link tokens are short-lived, one-time use. Access tokens don't expire but
may need updating when users change passwords.


### Transactions Sync
Use /transactions/sync for incremental transaction updates. More efficient
than /transactions/get. Handle webhooks for real-time updates instead of
polling.


### Item Error Handling and Update Mode
Handle ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED errors by putting users through Link update mode.
Listen for PENDING_DISCONNECT webhook to proactively prompt users.


### Auth for ACH Transfers
Use Auth product to get account and routing numbers for ACH transfers.
Combine with Identity to verify account ownership before initiating
transfers.


### Real-Time Balance Check
Use /accounts/balance/get for real-time balance (paid endpoint).
/accounts/get returns cached data suitable for display but not
real-time decisions.


### Webhook Verification
Verify Plaid webhooks using the verification key endpoint.
Handle duplicate webhooks idempotently and design for out-of-order
delivery.



## Anti-Patterns

### Storing Access Tokens in Plain Text
Access tokens grant full account access and must be encrypted

### Polling Instead of Webhooks
Webhooks are more efficient than constant polling

### Ignoring Item Errors
Item errors require user action through update mode

### Using Public Key Instead of Link Token
Public key integration ended January 2025
