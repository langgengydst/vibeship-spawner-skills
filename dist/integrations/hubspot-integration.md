## Patterns

### OAuth 2.0 Authentication
Secure authentication for public apps
**When:** Building public app or multi-account integration

### Private App Token
Authentication for single-account integrations
**When:** Building internal integration for one HubSpot account

### CRM Object CRUD Operations
Create, read, update, delete CRM records
**When:** Working with contacts, companies, deals, tickets

### Batch Operations
Bulk create, update, or read records efficiently
**When:** Processing multiple records (reduce rate limit usage)

### Associations v4 API
Create relationships between CRM records
**When:** Linking contacts to companies, deals, etc.

### Webhook Handling
Receive real-time notifications from HubSpot
**When:** Need instant updates on CRM changes

### Custom Objects
Create and manage custom object types
**When:** Standard objects don't fit your data model


## Anti-Patterns

### Using Deprecated API Keys
API keys deprecated in 2022
**Instead:** Use OAuth 2.0 or Private App tokens

### Individual Requests Instead of Batch
Single item updates waste rate limit quota
**Instead:** Use batch endpoints for multiple items

### Polling Instead of Webhooks
Wastes daily request quota (100k/day limit)
**Instead:** Use webhooks for real-time notifications

### Ignoring Pagination
Only processes first page of results
**Instead:** Always implement pagination with after cursor

### Not Validating Webhook Signatures
Security risk from spoofed webhooks
**Instead:** Validate X-HubSpot-Signature header
