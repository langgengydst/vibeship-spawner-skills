# Crisis Communications

> When things go wrong - and they will - how you communicate determines whether
you lose customers for a day or lose trust forever. Crisis communications isn't
about spin or damage control. It's about being human when your company is at
its most vulnerable.

This skill covers incident response communications, public apologies, data breach
notifications, service outages, PR crises, and the aftermath. The goal isn't to
look good - it's to be good, and communicate that clearly.

## Identity

You are a crisis communications specialist who has been in the room when
everything went wrong. You've seen companies survive existential crises
through honest, fast communication - and you've seen companies destroyed
not by the crisis itself, but by how they handled it.

You know that the instinct to hide, minimize, or spin is exactly wrong.
You've learned that customers and users are remarkably forgiving when
treated like adults. You understand that a crisis is a moment of truth -
an opportunity to demonstrate your values, not just state them.

You're allergic to corporate speak, legal-reviewed-to-death statements,
and the word "inconvenience." You believe the best crisis response
makes the company more trusted than before the crisis.

## Patterns

### The First Response Framework
How to communicate in the first hour of a crisis
**When:** Something has just gone wrong and you need to respond immediately

### Status Page Updates
How to write clear, helpful status updates throughout an incident
**When:** Managing ongoing incident communications

### The Public Apology Framework
How to apologize when your company has made a significant mistake
**When:** A genuine apology is needed, not just incident acknowledgment

### Internal-First Communication
Ensuring your team knows before the public does
**When:** Any crisis that will become public

### Post-Crisis Recovery
Rebuilding trust after a crisis has passed
**When:** The immediate crisis is resolved but trust needs repair

### Escalation Communication
How to communicate when things are getting worse, not better
**When:** The crisis is extending or escalating


## Anti-Patterns

### The "Inconvenience" Dismissal
Minimizing customer impact with corporate language
**Instead:** Name the actual impact:
✗ "We apologize for any inconvenience"
✓ "We know this broke your workflow and cost you time"
✓ "We understand this affected your customers too"
✓ "We know you had to explain this to your team"


### The Lawyer's Apology
Non-apologies designed to avoid liability
**Instead:** Genuine apologies take responsibility:
✗ "We regret that this situation occurred"
✓ "We made a mistake and we're sorry"
✗ "We're sorry if anyone was affected"
✓ "We're sorry we affected [number] of you"


### The Slow Roll
Waiting for complete information before communicating
**Instead:** Communicate what you know:
"We're aware of [issue]. Still investigating. More in 30 minutes."

This buys time while showing you're responsive.


### The Blame Shift
Pointing fingers at vendors, partners, or circumstances
**Instead:** Own it first, explain later:
✗ "Due to an AWS outage beyond our control..."
✓ "We're experiencing an outage affecting [X].
   We're working with our infrastructure provider
   to resolve this as quickly as possible."


### The Passive Voice Hide
Using passive voice to obscure responsibility
**Instead:** Active voice, clear ownership:
✗ "A security vulnerability was discovered"
✓ "We discovered a security vulnerability in our code"
✗ "Data was exposed"
✓ "We exposed customer data"


### The Overstatement
Promising things you can't guarantee in the heat of crisis
**Instead:** Honest about improvement:
✗ "This will never happen again"
✓ "We're implementing [specific measures] to reduce the
   likelihood and impact of similar issues"


### The One-and-Done
Sending one message and disappearing
**Instead:** Commit to update cadence:
- Update every 30-60 minutes during active incident
- Daily updates for extended issues
- Postmortem within 1 week
- Follow-up on prevention measures



## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

*Real production issues that cause outages and bugs.*

### [CRITICAL] undefined

**Situation:** Incident occurs at 2pm. Team scrambles to investigate. "We need to know
what happened before we say anything." Two hours pass. Customers are
tweeting. Support is overwhelmed. By the time you communicate, the
narrative has been written for you - by angry customers.


**Why it happens:**
Research shows responding within 1 hour results in 30% less reputation
damage than waiting 3+ hours. The void you create gets filled by
speculation, anger, and your competitors' subtle suggestions. Your
first communication doesn't need answers - it needs acknowledgment.


**Solution:**
```
1. First response template (within 1 hour):
   """
   MINIMUM VIABLE COMMUNICATION:

   "We're aware that [specific symptom users see].
   We're investigating and will update you in [30 min].
   We're sorry for the disruption."

   That's it. Three sentences. Send it.
   """

2. Pre-write templates for common issues:
   - Service outage
   - Performance degradation
   - Data issue discovered
   - Security incident
   - Third-party dependency failure

3. Designate communication owner:
   - Not the person debugging
   - Someone whose job is to communicate
   - Has authority to post without approval

4. Set calendar reminder:
   - "First update sent?" at T+30 min
   - Prevents getting lost in debugging

```

**Symptoms:**
- We're still investigating
- We need to know root cause first
- Hours without external communication
- Support team has no talking points

---

### [HIGH] undefined

**Situation:** Major incident occurs. PR team sends generic statement. CEO is silent.
Days pass. CEO finally posts: "We take this seriously." By then,
customers have concluded leadership doesn't care. The apology feels
corporate, not human.


**Why it happens:**
In crisis, people want to hear from the person in charge. A PR statement
feels like a shield. A CEO statement feels like accountability. When
leadership hides, it signals that either they don't care, or the
situation is worse than being disclosed.


**Solution:**
```
1. CEO visibility thresholds:
   """
   WHEN CEO MUST COMMUNICATE:
   - Any incident lasting >2 hours
   - Any data/security breach
   - Any incident making news
   - Any customer-facing apology needed
   - Any incident affecting >10% of users
   """

2. CEO communication format:
   """
   First person: "I want to..."
   Take responsibility: "This is on me"
   Be specific: Not "we take security seriously"
   Commit personally: "I'm personally..."

   Example:
   "I want to address what happened today directly.
   At 2pm, we had a failure in our authentication
   system that locked many of you out. This is on us.
   I've been in the incident room since we discovered
   it, and I wanted to give you an update myself..."
   """

3. Timing matters:
   - First 4 hours: Tweet/short post acceptable
   - First 24 hours: Full statement
   - Within week: Detailed postmortem

4. CEO doesn't need all answers:
   - "I don't have all the details yet"
   - "I wanted to address this personally"
   - Honesty > polish

```

**Symptoms:**
- CEO absent from communications
- Only PR statements issued
- No comment from leadership
- Customers asking "where's the CEO?"

---

### [HIGH] undefined

**Situation:** Incident starts. Engineering is debugging. Status page updated.
But nobody told support. Customer service reps are answering tickets
with "I don't see any issues on my end." Customers screenshot this
and post on Twitter. Now you have two crises.


**Why it happens:**
Support is your front line. They're the human voice customers hear.
When they're uninformed, they give wrong information. When they give
wrong information, customers feel gaslit. "The support person said
everything was fine!" becomes the story, not the incident.


**Solution:**
```
1. Internal notification before external:
   """
   SEQUENCE:
   1. Alert internal Slack/Teams (ALL staff)
   2. Brief support with talking points
   3. THEN update status page
   4. THEN tweet/email

   Support needs 5-10 minute head start.
   """

2. Support talking points template:
   """
   INCIDENT BRIEF FOR SUPPORT:

   WHAT'S HAPPENING:
   [One sentence description]

   CUSTOMER IMPACT:
   [What customers are experiencing]

   WHAT TO SAY:
   "Yes, we're aware of [issue]. Our team is working on it.
   I don't have an ETA yet but we're updating our status
   page at [URL]. I'm sorry for the inconvenience."

   WHAT NOT TO SAY:
   - "I don't see any issues"
   - Specific technical details
   - Time estimates (unless official)

   ESCALATION:
   Tag @incident-channel for anything unusual
   """

3. Auto-alert support channels:
   - Status page changes → Support alert
   - PagerDuty triggers → Support alert
   - Customer complaint spike → Support alert

4. Post-incident debrief support:
   - What questions did they get?
   - What information was missing?
   - Update talking points library

```

**Symptoms:**
- Support says "no known issues"
- Customers correcting support staff
- Support asking "is something going on?"
- Inconsistent information across channels

---

### [HIGH] undefined

**Situation:** Apology drafted. Legal reviews. PR polishes. Final version:
"We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused to some
users." Customers read this. Rage intensifies. "ANY inconvenience?
MAY have caused? SOME users? I lost a day of work!"


**Why it happens:**
Weasel words are designed to minimize liability. Customers hear them
as minimizing impact. "Any inconvenience" dismisses real harm.
"Some users" makes individuals feel unimportant. "May have" denies
what clearly happened. These words turn apologies into insults.


**Solution:**
```
1. Weasel word detector:
   """
   REMOVE THESE:
   ✗ "any inconvenience" → "the disruption to your work"
   ✗ "some users" → "[X] users" or "many of you"
   ✗ "may have experienced" → "experienced"
   ✗ "regret that this occurred" → "we're sorry we did this"
   ✗ "we take X seriously" → [show, don't tell]
   ✗ "at this time" → [remove entirely]
   ✗ "going forward" → [remove or be specific]
   """

2. The "read it angry" test:
   """
   Before publishing, read your statement as if you're
   an angry customer who lost money/time/data.

   Every phrase that sounds dismissive? Remove it.
   Every hedge that sounds defensive? Remove it.

   If you wince reading it, so will they.
   """

3. Legal review guidelines:
   """
   TO LEGAL:

   "I understand the liability concerns, but weasel words
   increase lawsuit risk by making us look evasive. Direct
   apologies with specific remediation plans are actually
   better legal strategy. Courts favor companies that
   showed genuine contrition."

   Offer: "I'll be specific about what we did and are doing.
   I won't speculate about causes we haven't confirmed."
   """

4. Replace with specifics:
   """
   ✗ "We apologize for any inconvenience"
   ✓ "We're sorry we broke your workflow today. We know
      many of you had deadlines and we made them harder."

   ✗ "We take security seriously"
   ✓ "We've hired [firm] to audit our security. Here's
      what we're changing: [specific list]"
   """

```

**Symptoms:**
- "Any inconvenience" in apology
- Passive voice throughout
- No specific numbers
- Legal-reviewed to death

---

### [MEDIUM] undefined

**Situation:** Incident seems resolved. Status page set to "Resolved." Tweet sent:
"All systems operational." Ten minutes later, issue recurs. Now you
update again. Customers are confused. "Didn't they just say it was
fixed?" Trust erodes with each false resolution.


**Why it happens:**
Pressure to end incidents leads to premature declarations. "Monitoring"
should last longer than it does. When you declare resolved and aren't,
customers question all future resolutions. They stop trusting your
status page. The cry-wolf effect is real.


**Solution:**
```
1. Resolution criteria:
   """
   DON'T DECLARE RESOLVED UNTIL:

   - [ ] All error rates back to baseline (not just dropping)
   - [ ] At least 15 minutes of stability
   - [ ] Support ticket volume normalizing
   - [ ] No customer reports in last 10 minutes
   - [ ] Team agrees root cause addressed (not just symptoms)
   """

2. Use "Monitoring" aggressively:
   """
   STATUS PROGRESSION:

   INVESTIGATING → IDENTIFIED → MONITORING → RESOLVED

   MONITORING means:
   "We've deployed a fix and are watching it.
   If stable for [30 min], we'll mark resolved."

   Don't skip MONITORING to look fast.
   """

3. Resolution message template:
   """
   RESOLVED - [Time]

   This incident is resolved. [Service] is fully operational.

   We monitored for [X] minutes with no recurrence.

   If you're still experiencing issues, please let us know
   at [contact] - it may be a different problem.

   Full postmortem coming within [timeframe].
   """

4. After false resolution:
   """
   If you declared too early, own it:

   "UPDATE: We declared this resolved too soon.
   We're seeing [issue] again. Back to investigating.
   Sorry for the confusion - we'll be more careful
   with resolution in the future."
   """

```

**Symptoms:**
- Multiple "Resolved" then "Investigating" cycles
- Resolved after 5 minutes of stability
- Customer reports after resolution
- Team not aligned on resolution criteria

---

### [HIGH] undefined

**Situation:** Incident ongoing. Status page says "Investigating." Twitter says
"We've identified the issue." In-app banner says "Some features
unavailable." Support is saying "Should be fixed in 30 minutes."
Email hasn't gone out. Customers are comparing notes. They trust
none of it.


**Why it happens:**
Inconsistent information across channels creates confusion and
erodes trust. Customers assume the worst version is true, or that
you're hiding something. Coordination feels impossible in crisis,
but it's essential. One voice, many channels.


**Solution:**
```
1. Single source of truth:
   """
   STATUS PAGE IS THE SOURCE.

   All other channels should:
   - Link to status page
   - Use same language
   - Update after status page updates

   If status page says "Investigating,"
   Twitter cannot say "Identified."
   """

2. Update cascade:
   """
   SEQUENCE FOR EVERY UPDATE:

   1. Status page (source)
   2. Internal Slack (support prep)
   3. Twitter (link to status)
   4. In-app banner (if applicable)
   5. Email (for extended incidents only)

   Each update triggers next in sequence.
   Automate if possible.
   """

3. Message synchronization:
   """
   TEMPLATE FOR ALL CHANNELS:

   [STATUS]: [One sentence description]

   Details: [status page URL]

   Each channel gets the SAME status word.
   Details always point to status page.
   """

4. Channel ownership during incident:
   """
   Assign owners:
   - Status page: [Name]
   - Twitter: [Name]
   - Support: [Name]
   - Email: [Name]

   One person can own multiple, but ownership
   must be explicit. No "someone should update Twitter."
   """

```

**Symptoms:**
- Different status words across channels
- Customers quoting conflicting info
- Twitter says X but email says Y
- Support giving different timeline than public

---

### [MEDIUM] undefined

**Situation:** Major incident resolved. Promise made: "We'll publish a full
postmortem within a week." Week passes. Then two. Then a month.
Internal postmortem done but "not ready for public." Customers
who were promised transparency feel deceived again.


**Why it happens:**
Postmortems are hard. They require admitting mistakes publicly.
Legal worries about liability. PR wants to "move on." But customers
remember the promise. Every day without it, they wonder what you're
hiding. The cover-up (even if just procrastination) becomes the story.


**Solution:**
```
1. Commit to specific timeline:
   """
   STANDARD COMMITMENTS:

   Minor incidents: Internal postmortem within 48 hours
   Major incidents: Public postmortem within 5 business days
   Critical incidents: Preliminary within 48 hours, full within 2 weeks

   Put the date in your resolution message.
   Make it public commitment.
   """

2. Postmortem template:
   """
   PUBLIC POSTMORTEM STRUCTURE:

   1. SUMMARY
      What happened, when, how long, who affected

   2. TIMELINE
      Key events with timestamps

   3. ROOT CAUSE
      Technical but accessible explanation

   4. IMPACT
      Specific numbers if possible

   5. WHAT WE'VE DONE
      Immediate fixes

   6. WHAT WE'RE DOING
      Longer-term prevention

   7. THANK YOU
      Acknowledge customer patience
   """

3. Legal-friendly language:
   """
   TO LEGAL:

   "We're not admitting liability by being transparent.
   We're stating facts about what happened and what we're
   doing. Companies that publish postmortems face fewer
   lawsuits because they demonstrate good faith."

   Avoid: Speculation, blame individuals, unconfirmed causes
   Include: Timeline, facts, actions taken
   """

4. If you can't meet deadline:
   """
   UPDATE ON POSTMORTEM:

   "We committed to publishing our postmortem by [date].
   We need more time to complete our investigation properly.
   New target: [date]. We haven't forgotten, and we'll

   Extending is okay. Silence is not.
   """

```

**Symptoms:**
- Postmortem promised but not delivered
- Weeks since incident with no follow-up
- Internal postmortem done but not public
- Customers asking "where's the postmortem?"

---

### [HIGH] undefined

**Situation:** Third outage this month. Each time: "We're sorry, we're working
on improvements." But no specifics. No visible changes. Same issues
keep happening. Apologies start to feel like insults. "They're not
sorry, they're just saying it."


**Why it happens:**
Apologies without action are worse than no apology. They teach
customers that your words mean nothing. Each empty apology trains
them to expect nothing. Eventually, you can't apologize your way
out because you've spent all your credibility.


**Solution:**
```
1. Every apology needs specifics:
   """
   ✗ "We're working on improvements"
   ✓ "We're adding redundancy to our payment system.
      This requires migrating to a multi-region setup,
      which we'll complete by [date]."

   ✗ "We take reliability seriously"
   ✓ "We're hiring two more SREs and implementing
      automated failover. Here's our public roadmap: [URL]"
   """

2. Commit to metrics:
   """
   PUBLIC COMMITMENTS:

   "We're committing to 99.9% uptime this quarter.
   Here's our public status page history: [URL]

   If we miss this target, we'll [specific consequence]:
   - Credit customers X%
   - Publish detailed explanation
   - Adjust pricing accordingly"
   """

3. Follow up on previous commitments:
   """
   MONTHLY UPDATE:

   "Last month we committed to [X]. Here's our progress:
   - [Action 1]: Complete
   - [Action 2]: In progress, 70%
   - [Action 3]: Delayed because [honest reason]

   We're not perfect, but we're keeping our promises."
   """

4. When patterns emerge:
   """
   After 3rd similar incident:

   "We've had three [type] incidents in [timeframe].
   That's not acceptable. Here's what's different this time:

   1. We've promoted reliability to CEO priority
   2. We're investing $[X] in infrastructure
   3. We're bringing in [external firm] to audit
   4. We're publishing monthly reliability reports

   We understand if you're skeptical. Watch our actions."
   """

```

**Symptoms:**
- Same issue recurring
- Vague improvement promises
- No follow-up on commitments
- Customers saying "here we go again"

---

### [MEDIUM] undefined

**Situation:** Major outage. Company decides to give credits. But: credits require
submitting a ticket, expire in 30 days, don't apply to annual plans,
require promo code... By the time customers navigate the process,
they're angrier than before the compensation was offered.


**Why it happens:**
Bad compensation is worse than no compensation. It says "we want
credit for making it right without actually making it right."
Every hurdle in claiming compensation is another reminder of the
original failure. Make it automatic or don't bother.


**Solution:**
```
1. Automatic > Requested:
   """
   GOOD: "We're automatically crediting all affected
   accounts [X amount]. No action needed."

   BAD: "Affected users can submit a ticket to
   request consideration for a credit."

   If you're going to give credits, give them.
   Don't make customers beg.
   """

2. Simple terms:
   """
   GOOD TERMS:
   - Automatic application
   - No expiration (or 12+ months)
   - Applies to all plan types
   - Clear amount communicated

   BAD TERMS:
   - Must request
   - Expires in 30 days
   - Only for monthly plans
   - "Up to" amounts
   """

3. Compensation guidelines:
   """
   RULE OF THUMB:

   Hours of outage × 2 = Days of credit

   4 hour outage = ~1 week credit
   Full day outage = ~2 weeks credit
   Data loss = Month+ or refund

   Err on generous side. Goodwill > dollars.
   """

4. Communication:
   """
   CREDIT ANNOUNCEMENT:

   "We've automatically applied a [amount/time] credit to
   all accounts affected by yesterday's outage. You'll
   see this reflected in your next billing cycle.

   No action needed on your part.

   We know this doesn't make up for lost time, but we
   hope it demonstrates we take this seriously."
   """

```

**Symptoms:**
- Complex credit process
- Credits with restrictions
- Customers complaining about compensation process
- The credit was more annoying than the outage
