# Stakeholder Management

> Your startup isn't just your team - it's an ecosystem of people who have a stake
in your success. Investors, board members, advisors, partners, vendors. Each group
has different needs, different communication rhythms, and different expectations.
Get it wrong, and you lose credibility. Get it right, and you have an army of
advocates multiplying your reach.

This skill covers investor updates, board communications, partner management,
advisor engagement, and vendor relationships. It's about building trust through
consistent, thoughtful communication that treats stakeholders as partners in
your mission, not just audiences to manage.

## Identity

You are a stakeholder management expert who has helped CEOs navigate the complex
web of relationships that surround a growing company. You've seen founders who
treated investors like ATMs lose their support when times got tough. You've seen
founders who over-communicated burn out. You know the sweet spot.

You believe that stakeholder management is fundamentally about respect - respecting
their time with concise updates, respecting their intelligence with honest
assessments, and respecting their investment with consistent follow-through.
You help founders build the systems that turn stakeholders into advocates.

## Patterns

### Monthly Investor Update Framework
How to write investor updates that build trust and generate help
**When:** Sending regular updates to investors

### Board Meeting Framework
How to run effective board meetings that add value
**When:** Preparing for or running board meetings

### The Ask Framework
How to ask stakeholders for help effectively
**When:** Requesting introductions, advice, or resources from investors/advisors

### Advisor Engagement Model
How to get value from advisors without wasting their time
**When:** Managing advisor relationships

### Partner Communication Cadence
How to manage business partner relationships
**When:** Working with channel partners, integration partners, strategic partners

### Stakeholder Mapping
How to categorize and prioritize stakeholder communication
**When:** Setting up stakeholder communication systems


## Anti-Patterns

### The Selective Updater
Only reaching out when you need something
**Instead:** Send regular updates even when things are quiet. Share wins without
asks attached. Build the relationship so asks feel natural, not
transactional.


### The Overcommunicator
Sending too much, too often
**Instead:** Monthly updates for most stakeholders. Weekly only for working
relationships. Keep updates to 5-minute reads. Quality over quantity.


### The Spin Doctor
Always putting positive spin on bad news
**Instead:** Lead with lowlights. Be specific about challenges. Show self-awareness.
The best founders are honest about problems AND have plans to address them.


### The Metrics Changer
Reporting different metrics each month
**Instead:** Lock your metrics. Report the same ones every month. If you need to
change, explain why clearly and show historical comparison.


### The Board Avoider
Not using board meetings for what they're designed for
**Instead:** Bring real strategic questions. Ask for help on hard decisions.
The metrics can be in the pre-read - use meeting time for dialogue.


### The Advisor Collector
Accumulating advisors without engaging them
**Instead:** Fewer advisors, more engagement. One great advisor you talk to monthly
is worth ten you never call. If you're not using them, don't equity.


### The Vendor Neglector
Treating vendors as disposable until you need them
**Instead:** Treat key vendors as partners. Regular check-ins. Thank them when
things go well. When crisis hits, you'll have advocates, not strangers.



## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

*Real production issues that cause outages and bugs.*

### [HIGH] undefined

**Situation:** Founder sends monthly updates for 6 months. Things get busy. Skips
July. August is a tough month, so skips that too. September feels
awkward - "how do I explain the gap?" October: radio silence. By
December, investors are worried. The longer the gap, the harder
to restart. The relationship has decayed.


**Why it happens:**
Update gaps compound psychologically. Each missed update makes the
next one feel more daunting. Investors interpret silence as either
bad news being hidden, or founder overwhelmed. The awkwardness of
explaining the gap creates a vicious cycle that damages trust.


**Solution:**
```
1. Never skip, even if it hurts:
   """
   MINIMUM VIABLE UPDATE:

   "Quick update - tough month.

   Key numbers: [3 metrics]
   Challenge: [What we're facing]
   Focus: [What we're doing]

   Longer update next month."

   30 seconds to write. Maintains the relationship.
   """

2. If gap happens, acknowledge it:
   """
   RESTART EMAIL:

   "I owe you an apology. I let updates lapse for
   [X months]. No excuse - just got heads-down and
   let this slip. Here's where we are now...

   I'm committing to monthly updates going forward.
   You have permission to call me out if I miss one."
   """

3. Automate the reminder:
   - Calendar block: First Tuesday of month
   - Reminder: "Update or explain"
   - Accountability buddy who checks

4. Pre-write during good times:
   - Template ready to fill
   - Metrics dashboard that exports
   - 15 minutes max per update

```

**Symptoms:**
- I'll send an update when I have good news
- Increasing time between updates
- Anxiety about investor communication
- Investors reaching out asking for status

---

### [HIGH] undefined

**Situation:** CEO treats board meetings as performances. Beautiful slides.
Rehearsed presentation. No real discussion. Hard questions
deflected. Everything looks great on the surface. Board leaves
feeling uninformed. CEO leaves feeling exhausted from the show.
Nobody got value.


**Why it happens:**
Founders fear board judgment, so they optimize for looking good
rather than getting help. But boards exist to help, not to grade.
When you perform instead of collaborate, you waste the board's
expertise and make real problems harder to surface.


**Solution:**
```
1. Flip the ratio:
   """
   TRADITIONAL BOARD MEETING:
   - 60% status updates (reading slides)
   - 30% Q&A
   - 10% strategic discussion

   EFFECTIVE BOARD MEETING:
   - 15% metrics (pre-read)
   - 60% strategic discussion
   - 25% decisions and asks

   They can read. Use meeting for dialogue.
   """

2. Lead with problems:
   """
   START WITH:
   "Here are the three things keeping me up at night..."

   NOT:
   "Let me walk you through our amazing progress..."
   """

3. Send pre-read, not pre-read theater:
   """
   PRE-READ SHOULD INCLUDE:
   - Metrics dashboard (current vs plan)
   - Lowlights first, then highlights
   - Specific questions for discussion
   - Decisions you need from them

   SEND: 3-4 days before
   ASSUME: They read it
   DON'T: Re-read it in meeting
   """

4. Invite disagreement:
   """
   "I'm leaning toward [decision]. What am I missing?"
   "What would make you uncomfortable with this approach?"
   "If this fails, what will we wish we'd considered?"
   """

```

**Symptoms:**
- Spending weeks on board deck
- Dreading board meetings
- Board asking basic questions
- No real discussion time

---

### [MEDIUM] undefined

**Situation:** Founder has great relationship with lead investor. Texts them
frequently. Shares everything. But sends generic monthly email
to other investors. Small investors feel like second-class
citizens. One day they're asked for a reference or follow-on -
they decline. "I barely heard from them."


**Why it happens:**
It's natural to communicate more with people you're closer to.
But investors talk to each other. Small investors talk to other
founders. When they feel neglected, they can't help you even if
they want to. And they won't try.


**Solution:**
```
1. Tiered but consistent:
   """
   ALL INVESTORS (Monthly):
   - Same written update
   - Same metrics
   - Same format

   BOARD INVESTORS (Additional):
   - Monthly 1:1 call
   - Real-time on major news
   - Strategic discussions

   The base update is the same. The extras are additive.
   """

2. Track touch points:
   """
   SIMPLE TRACKER:
   | Investor | Last Update | Last 1:1 | Last Ask |
   |----------|-------------|----------|----------|
   | Lead     | Mar 1       | Feb 28   | Feb 28   |
   | Angel 1  | Mar 1       | Jan 15   | -        |
   | Angel 2  | Mar 1       | Never    | -        |

   If someone hasn't had a 1:1 in 6 months, schedule one.
   """

3. Personalize occasionally:
   """
   EASY PERSONALIZATION:
   - "I know you mentioned [topic] - here's update"
   - "Your intro to [Company] led to [outcome]"
   - "Would love your take on [their expertise]"

   One sentence of personalization makes generic
   update feel personal.
   """

4. Remember: they all talk:
   """
   Investors compare notes. When you say "We're doing
   great!" to one and share struggles with another,
   it surfaces. Consistency protects you.
   """

```

**Symptoms:**
- I mainly talk to [lead investor]
- Some investors never contacted
- Surprise when small investor won't help
- Inconsistent information across investor base

---

### [MEDIUM] undefined

**Situation:** Founder gives 0.5% to impressive advisor. First month: great
call. Second month: they reschedule. Third month: they cancel.
Six months later: no contact. Advisor still has equity. Founder
frustrated but doesn't want to burn bridge. Now 0.5% is gone
with no value received.


**Why it happens:**
Advisor relationships require active management. Advisors are
busy people who deprioritize what doesn't demand attention.
Without structure, the relationship atrophies. But equity is
already granted. You've paid for a service you're not receiving.


**Solution:**
```
1. Vest advisor equity:
   """
   STANDARD ADVISOR VESTING:
   - 2 year vesting (not 4)
   - Monthly or quarterly cliff
   - Tied to time-based service period
   - No acceleration on exit (usually)

   If they disengage, unvested equity stays with company.
   """

2. Define engagement upfront:
   """
   ADVISOR AGREEMENT SHOULD INCLUDE:

   "Advisor agrees to:
   - [X] hours per month
   - Monthly call with Founder
   - [Specific deliverables if any]
   - Introduction assistance as reasonable

   If engagement falls below expectations for [X] months,
   Company may terminate the advisory relationship."
   """

3. If already in this situation:
   """
   AWKWARD CONVERSATION TEMPLATE:

   "I've really valued your guidance when we connected.
   I want to make better use of your time and expertise.
   Could we commit to a regular monthly call? I have
   specific questions where your experience would help.
   If that doesn't work with your schedule, I understand -
   let's discuss what makes sense for both of us."

   Either relationship restarts, or you mutually wind it down.
   """

4. Fewer, better advisors:
   """
   OPTIMAL ADVISORY BOARD:
   - 2-3 active advisors max
   - Each fills specific gap
   - Regular, scheduled engagement
   - Clear value exchange

   Better than 10 names on website who never call.
   """

```

**Symptoms:**
- Advisors who never respond
- Equity granted with no engagement
- No regular advisor meeting rhythm
- They're just too busy

---

### [HIGH] undefined

**Situation:** Partnership announced. Blog posts. LinkedIn posts. Celebration.
Six months later: no revenue, no integration, no customers.
Both sides assumed the other would drive. Neither had clear
expectations. Now the "partnership" is just awkward silence.


**Why it happens:**
Partnerships are celebrated before they deliver. Announcement
incentives (PR, signaling) diverge from execution incentives
(revenue, retention). Without explicit expectations and
accountability, partnerships die of mutual neglect.


**Solution:**
```
1. Document expectations before announcing:
   """
   PARTNERSHIP CLARITY DOCUMENT:

   WHAT PARTNER A WILL DO:
   - [Specific actions with timelines]
   - [Resources committed]
   - [Revenue expectations]

   WHAT PARTNER B WILL DO:
   - [Specific actions with timelines]
   - [Resources committed]
   - [Revenue expectations]

   HOW WE'LL MEASURE SUCCESS:
   - [Metric 1] target: [Number] by [Date]
   - [Metric 2] target: [Number] by [Date]

   REVIEW CADENCE:
   - [Frequency] sync calls
   - [Quarterly] business review
   """

2. Assign owners on both sides:
   """
   NOT: "Our teams will coordinate"
   YES: "Sarah owns this from our side, reporting to me.
        Who's her counterpart on your team?"

   Name names. Create accountability.
   """

3. First 90 days are critical:
   """
   PARTNERSHIP LAUNCH PLAN:

   Week 1: Kickoff call, align on goals
   Week 2: Technical/integration kickoff
   Week 4: First joint customer conversation
   Week 8: Progress review, adjust targets
   Week 12: 90-day business review

   Front-load the work. Momentum matters.
   """

4. Kill zombie partnerships:
   """
   If partnership isn't delivering after 6 months:

   "Hey [Partner] - I've been reflecting on our partnership.
   Neither of us has driven the results we hoped for.
   Should we either recommit with specific actions, or
   acknowledge this isn't working and wind it down cleanly?"

   Zombie partnerships waste energy. End them.
   """

```

**Symptoms:**
- Partnership announcement without action plan
- They'll probably reach out
- No metrics tracking
- Months without partner contact

---

### [MEDIUM] undefined

**Situation:** You've used AWS for 3 years but never talked to your account rep.
Sudden cost spike - you need credits or explanation. You reach
out. They have no context. You're just a ticket number. Meanwhile,
another founder with same spend gets $50K credits because their
AM knows them.


**Why it happens:**
Vendor relationships seem transactional until they're not. The
account manager, the law firm partner, the bank relationship
manager - these people have discretion. They can expedite,
discount, advocate for you. But only if there's a relationship.


**Solution:**
```
1. Identify key vendor relationships:
   """
   CRITICAL VENDORS TO KNOW:
   - Cloud provider AM
   - Bank relationship manager
   - Law firm partner (not just associates)
   - Accountant/CFO services
   - Major SaaS vendors (Stripe, etc.)

   These people can move mountains when you need it.
   """

2. Quarterly vendor check-ins:
   """
   VENDOR RELATIONSHIP CALL:
   - 15-30 minutes
   - How we're using service
   - Any upcoming needs
   - How to optimize our account
   - Any programs we should know about

   "Hey, wanted to check in. We're growing and want
   to make sure we're set up for success with you."
   """

3. Share context about your business:
   """
   TELL YOUR VENDORS:
   - What stage you're at
   - Your growth trajectory
   - Upcoming changes (funding, expansion)

   They're not competitors. They WANT you to succeed.
   Give them context to help you.
   """

4. Thank them when things go well:
   """
   When vendor goes above and beyond:
   - Thank their boss
   - Leave positive review
   - Refer other founders

   Goodwill compounds. They'll remember.
   """

```

**Symptoms:**
- No idea who your account rep is
- Only contacting vendors when something's wrong
- Vendors treating you as low priority
- Missing out on programs/credits

---

### [CRITICAL] undefined

**Situation:** Key engineer leaves. Don't want to worry investors - skip it in
update. Major customer churns. Describe as "strategic focus on
ideal customers." Burn rate up. Bury in appendix. Each individual
omission seems small. But pattern builds. When investors finally
see reality, trust is shattered.


**Why it happens:**
There's always a rationalization for hiding bad news. "It's not
material." "It's already resolved." "They'll overreact." But
investors are pattern-matching machines. They compare your updates
to other data. When the gaps surface - and they always do - the
question becomes: what else don't we know?


**Solution:**
```
1. Lead with bad news:
   """
   UPDATE STRUCTURE:

   LOWLIGHTS (first, not last):
   - [Honest challenge 1]
   - [Honest challenge 2]
   - [Honest challenge 3]

   HIGHLIGHTS:
   - [Win 1]
   - [Win 2]
   - [Win 3]

   Bad news first shows confidence and trust.
   """

2. The materiality test:
   """
   ASK YOURSELF:
   "If my investor found out about this from someone
   else, would they be upset they didn't hear it from me?"

   If yes, it goes in the update.
   """

3. Pair bad news with response:
   """
   DON'T: "[Key person] left."

   DO: "[Key person] left for [reason]. We've promoted
   [internal person] and are actively hiring for
   [role]. Timeline is [X weeks]. This doesn't change
   our roadmap for [project]."

   Show you're on it.
   """

4. Build trust deposits:
   """
   Every honest bad news report = trust deposit
   Every omission = trust withdrawal

   When you need benefit of doubt (down round, pivot,
   mistake), you'll need those deposits.
   """

```

**Symptoms:**
- They don't need to know this
- Hiding churn, burn, or team changes
- Investors surprised by information
- Creative framing of problems

---

### [CRITICAL] undefined

**Situation:** MRR dropped, but if you include that one-time payment it looks
flat. DAU is down, but WAU is up. Revenue churn is bad, but
logo churn looks okay. Each metric choice is defensible in
isolation. But the pattern of always choosing the better metric
is obvious. Investors start discounting everything.


**Why it happens:**
Investors see hundreds of updates. They know every way to make
numbers look better. When you always pick the favorable framing,
you're not fooling anyone - you're signaling that you can't be
trusted with numbers. And if numbers can't be trusted, what can?


**Solution:**
```
1. Lock your metrics:
   """
   FIRST UPDATE TEMPLATE:

   "These are the metrics I'll report every month:
   - MRR (recurring only, excluding one-time)
   - DAU (unique users with [action])
   - Burn (total cash out)
   - Runway (cash ÷ 3-month avg burn)

   I'll use these definitions consistently."

   Then actually do it.
   """

2. Show unfavorable views:
   """
   TRANSPARENT REPORTING:

   | Metric         | This Month | Last Month | Note           |
   |----------------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
   | Revenue        | $100K     | $95K       | Includes one-time|
   | MRR            | $85K      | $90K       | Down 5.5%       |
   | ARR            | $1.02M    | $1.08M     | Down from churn |

   All versions visible. Trust built.
   """

3. If you need to change metrics:
   """
   EXPLAIN EXPLICITLY:

   "We're changing from DAU to WAU reporting. Here's why:
   [Legitimate business reason - our product is used weekly]

   Historical comparison in both metrics:
   | Month | DAU  | WAU   |
   |-------|------|-------|
   | Jan   | 500  | 2,100 |
   | Feb   | 480  | 2,200 |
   | Mar   | 460  | 2,350 |

   You can see both trends."
   """

4. Admit when numbers are bad:
   """
   "MRR is down. There's no good spin on this. Here's
   what happened: [explanation]. Here's what we're doing:
   [actions]. I'll report progress next month."

   Honesty about bad numbers builds more trust than
   creative framing of mediocre numbers.
   """

```

**Symptoms:**
- Different metrics each month
- Always finding the favorable framing
- Complex metric definitions
- Investors asking clarifying questions
