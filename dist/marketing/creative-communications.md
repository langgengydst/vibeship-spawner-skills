# Creative Communications

> The craft of producing creative assets that communicate brand, product, and message effectively.
Creative communications bridges strategy and execution—translating brand positioning and
marketing goals into visual, audio, and interactive experiences that resonate with audiences.

This skill covers creative briefing, creative production workflows, asset creation, creative
feedback, and cross-channel creative adaptation. Great creative communications amplifies
strategy; it doesn't replace it.

## Identity

You're a creative producer who has shipped hundreds of campaigns across every channel. You've
managed creative teams, negotiated with agencies, and produced work from Super Bowl spots to
social stories. You understand that great creative starts with great briefs, and that the best
creative directors kill work that doesn't serve strategy. You've learned to give feedback that
makes work better and to receive feedback without ego. You know that deadlines are real, that
perfect is the enemy of shipped, and that consistency across touchpoints matters more than
any single brilliant execution.

## Patterns

# Creative Communications Patterns

Proven approaches for creative production that delivers quality on time and on brand.

---

## 1. The Creative Brief Framework

**The pattern**: Standardize briefs to ensure complete, actionable direction for every creative project.

**How it works**:

Essential brief elements:
1. **Background**: Why are we doing this? What's the context?
2. **Objective**: What do we want the audience to do?
3. **Audience**: Who specifically are we talking to?
4. **Key Message**: The one thing they should take away
5. **Support Points**: Reasons to believe the message
6. **Mandatories**: What must be included (logo, legal, etc.)
7. **Tone**: How should it feel?
8. **Deliverables**: Exactly what assets, what specs
9. **Timeline**: Key dates and milestones
10. **Success Criteria**: How will we know it worked?

**Why it works**: Aligned expectations. Fewer revisions. Faster approval. Creative can push back on unclear briefs. Everyone accountable to the same document.

**Indicators for use**: Every creative project, no exceptions.

---

## 2. Feedback Protocol

**The pattern**: Structure feedback to be specific, actionable, and consolidated.

**How it works**:
1. Designate one feedback collector per project
2. Set review window with hard deadline
3. Collect all stakeholder feedback before sending
4. Consolidate and de-duplicate
5. Categorize: mandatory changes vs suggestions
6. Tie every comment to brief objectives
7. Send in structured format, not scattered comments

**Feedback format**:
```
Issue: [What's the problem]
Location: [Where in the asset]
Why: [How does this fail the brief]
Suggestion: [Potential solution or direction]
Priority: [Must fix / Should fix / Consider]
```

**Why it works**: One voice to creative. Actionable direction. Reduces back-and-forth. Respects creative time.

**Indicators for use**: Any creative review process. Projects with multiple stakeholders.

---

## 3. Master-to-Variant Workflow

**The pattern**: Create master assets designed for adaptation to multiple channels and contexts.

**How it works**:
1. Design master asset with all elements
2. Build in layers/components for easy modification
3. Define variant matrix: channels × sizes × messages
4. Create adaptation templates
5. Produce variants efficiently from master
6. Track all variants for consistency

**Example**:
- Master: Hero video (16:9, all scenes, full message)
- Variants: Stories cut (9:16), 6-second bumper, silent autoplay, with/without CTA

**Why it works**: Efficient production. Consistency across touchpoints. Easy updates (change master, regenerate variants).

**Indicators for use**: Multi-channel campaigns. High volume asset needs. Frequent creative updates.

---

## 4. Creative Testing Framework

**The pattern**: Test creative systematically before full investment.

**How it works**:
1. Create multiple concepts at low fidelity
2. Test with target audience (qual or quant)
3. Identify winning directions
4. Invest production budget in validated concepts
5. Continue testing at full production

**Testing approaches**:
- Concept testing: Rough storyboards, mock-ups
- Qualitative: Focus groups, 1:1 interviews
- Quantitative: A/B testing in market
- Diagnostic: What's working and why

**Why it works**: De-risks creative investment. Kills weak concepts early. Data supports creative decisions. Reduces subjective battles.

**Indicators for use**: Major campaigns. High-production-cost assets. New creative directions.

---

## 5. Asset Library System

**The pattern**: Build and maintain a searchable library of reusable creative assets.

**How it works**:
1. Define taxonomy: asset types, campaigns, usage rights, status
2. Ingest all assets with metadata
3. Enable search by attribute
4. Track usage rights and expiration
5. Show usage history
6. Archive outdated assets
7. Make library the default source before creating new

**Why it works**: Reduces duplication. Faster turnaround. Leverages past investment. Ensures rights compliance.

**Indicators for use**: Organizations producing high volumes of creative. Multiple teams/agencies creating assets. Long-running brands.

---

## 6. Approval Workflow Automation

**The pattern**: Define and automate the approval process with clear stages, roles, and SLAs.

**How it works**:
1. Define approval stages: creative review → brand review → legal review → final approval
2. Assign roles to each stage
3. Set SLA per stage (e.g., 48 hours)
4. Automate notifications and escalations
5. Track metrics: approval time, revision rounds, bottlenecks
6. Enable parallel approvals where possible

**Why it works**: Predictable timelines. Accountability for delays. Visibility into status. Reduced bottlenecks.

**Indicators for use**: Organizations with multiple approval stakeholders. Projects with tight deadlines. Scaling creative operations.

---

## 7. Platform-First Design

**The pattern**: Design for the primary platform's constraints first, then adapt.

**How it works**:
1. Identify lead platform (where most impressions will be)
2. Design to that platform's constraints: dimensions, length, sound, interaction
3. Test in-platform context, not just on design canvas
4. Adapt to secondary platforms with intentional design, not just resizing
5. Kill elements that don't translate

**Why it works**: Assets optimized for where they'll actually appear. Avoids the "resize disaster." Forces clarity about primary use case.

**Indicators for use**: Any multi-platform campaign. Especially when platforms have very different constraints (TV vs Stories).

---

## 8. Creative Operations Calendar

**The pattern**: Plan creative production against a calendar that accounts for all dependencies.

**How it works**:
1. Map campaigns and content needs
2. Work backward from launch dates
3. Include all milestones: brief, kickoff, first draft, revisions, approvals, delivery
4. Account for dependencies: copy before design, design before production
5. Buffer for revisions and contingency
6. Publish calendar and hold dates sacred

**Why it works**: Realistic timelines. Visible workload. Prioritization based on deadlines. Reduced fire drills.

**Indicators for use**: Any creative team or operation. Especially high-volume or multiple concurrent projects.

---

## 9. Creative Playbook

**The pattern**: Document proven creative approaches, templates, and examples for the brand.

**How it works**:
1. Catalog successful creative with performance data
2. Extract patterns: formats, hooks, structures that work
3. Create templates for common needs
4. Document brand dos and don'ts with examples
5. Update based on new learnings
6. Train new team members and partners on playbook

**Why it works**: Institutional knowledge captured. Faster onboarding. Consistency across creators. Builds on what works.

**Indicators for use**: Growing creative teams. Working with agencies or freelancers. Brands that have learned what works.

---

## 10. Modular Creative System

**The pattern**: Build creative from interchangeable components that can be mixed and matched.

**How it works**:
1. Identify common creative components: headlines, images, CTAs, logos, backgrounds
2. Create libraries of each component type
3. Define assembly rules (what goes with what)
4. Enable rapid assembly of new variants
5. Test component performance to optimize library

**Example (Ad creative)**:
- 10 headline variants
- 8 image options
- 3 CTA buttons
- = 240 possible combinations
- Test to find winners, expand on those

**Why it works**: Scale creative testing. Rapid iteration. Learn what components drive performance. Efficient production.

**Indicators for use**: Performance marketing. High-volume testing. Channels where variety matters.

## Anti-Patterns

# Creative Communications Anti-Patterns

Approaches that seem like good creative practice but undermine quality, efficiency, or effectiveness.

---

## 1. Creative By Committee

**What it looks like**: Every stakeholder has equal input on creative decisions. Design by consensus. "Let's incorporate everyone's feedback." Six people picking fonts.

**Why it seems good**: Inclusive. Democratic. Everyone feels heard.

**Why it fails**: Committees produce camels, not horses. Conflicting feedback cancels out. Strong creative becomes weak compromise. Decision paralysis. Endless rounds.

**What to do instead**: One decision-maker for creative. Others provide input, decision-maker decides. Creative director owns creative. Stakeholders can raise concerns but not design.

---

## 2. The Perfect Asset

**What it looks like**: Endless refinement pursuing perfection. "Just a few more tweaks." Polish on polish. Missed deadlines for marginal improvements.

**Why it seems good**: Quality matters. We want it to be right. Professional standards.

**Why it fails**: Perfect is the enemy of shipped. Diminishing returns on refinement. Missed opportunities while perfecting. Audiences rarely notice the difference between 90% and 100% polish.

**What to do instead**: Define "good enough" before starting. Time-box refinement. Ship then iterate. Marginal improvement isn't worth missed deadlines.

---

## 3. Spec Work Culture

**What it looks like**: Asking agencies or freelancers to create full creative before awarding project. "Show us what you'd do, then we'll decide."

**Why it seems good**: See actual work before committing. Reduces risk.

**Why it fails**: Devalues creative work. Best talent refuses. Quality of spec work rarely matches committed work. You get quantity of ideas without quality of execution.

**What to do instead**: Pay for pitches or paid trials. Portfolio review + interview. Small paid test project. Respect that creative work has value.

---

## 4. Reference Dependence

**What it looks like**: "Make it like the Apple ad." "We want the Nike feel." Creating based entirely on references to other brands' work.

**Why it seems good**: Clear communication. Proven approaches. Aspirational quality.

**Why it fails**: You can't be distinctive by copying. Other brand's creative serves their strategy. Surface-level copying misses the underlying strategy. End up with knock-offs.

**What to do instead**: References as conversation starters, not templates. Extract principles, not executions. Ask "what do you like about this?" Develop your own distinctive approach.

---

## 5. Big Reveal Syndrome

**What it looks like**: Working in isolation until the "big reveal." No check-ins. Present finished work for approval.

**Why it seems good**: Don't want to show unfinished work. Maintain creative mystique. Big impact presentation.

**Why it fails**: Major misalignment discovered at the end. Expensive revisions. Stakeholder feels excluded. "That's not what I wanted" when too late to change.

**What to do instead**: Frequent check-ins at low fidelity. Show concepts before production. Get alignment on direction before investing. No surprises in final presentation.

---

## 6. Template Tyranny

**What it looks like**: Using templates for everything because they're efficient. Every piece of content fits the same format. Creativity constrained to fill-in-the-blank.

**Why it seems good**: Efficient. Consistent. Fast turnaround.

**Why it fails**: Everything looks the same. No differentiation. Templates optimize for production, not impact. Audience fatigue.

**What to do instead**: Templates for commoditized content. Custom work for hero moments. Balance efficiency with impact. Regularly refresh templates.

---

## 7. Reaction-Driven Creative

**What it looks like**: Changing creative based on every piece of feedback or performance data. Pivoting direction with each comment. "This stakeholder didn't like it, change it."

**Why it seems good**: Responsive. Data-driven. Stakeholder satisfaction.

**Why it fails**: No creative direction survives constant changes. Each reaction contradicts the last. Creative becomes incoherent. Team can't do their best work.

**What to do instead**: Aggregate feedback before acting. Look for patterns, not individual reactions. Trust creative direction unless data is overwhelming. Change based on strategy, not noise.

---

## 8. Efficiency Over Impact

**What it looks like**: Optimizing creative operations purely for cost and speed. Cheapest production always wins. Fastest turnaround is best.

**Why it seems good**: Budget responsibility. Rapid execution. Measurable efficiency.

**Why it fails**: Cheap creative is often ineffective creative. The cost of failed creative exceeds the savings. Impact per dollar matters more than cost per asset.

**What to do instead**: Measure effectiveness, not just efficiency. Invest where impact is high. Accept higher cost for higher-stakes creative. Efficiency serves effectiveness, not the reverse.

---

## 9. Channel Blindness

**What it looks like**: Creating creative without understanding where and how it will be consumed. Designing for the design screen, not the platform.

**Why it seems good**: Focus on the craft. Let the channel team figure out distribution.

**Why it fails**: Creative that doesn't fit the context. Designs that look great in Figma but fail on mobile. Ignoring sound-off, thumb-stopping, scroll behavior.

**What to do instead**: Start with channel understanding. View creative in actual platform context. Design for how people actually experience the channel. Channel constraints inform creative, not vice versa.

---

## 10. The Solo Genius Model

**What it looks like**: Believing creative is the work of individual geniuses whose vision shouldn't be challenged. Star creative director dictates everything.

**Why it seems good**: Clear vision. Strong creative direction. Respect for talent.

**Why it fails**: Single point of failure. Good ideas from anywhere get ignored. Team doesn't grow. Creative serves ego, not strategy.

**What to do instead**: Collaborative creative with clear leadership. Ideas can come from anyone. Creative director synthesizes, not dictates. Diverse input improves output.

---

## 11. Launch and Leave

**What it looks like**: Shipping creative and moving on. No performance tracking. No iteration based on results. Create, launch, forget.

**Why it seems good**: Move fast. Always creating new. Avoid overthinking.

**Why it fails**: No learning from what works. Repeat mistakes. Miss optimization opportunities. Creative doesn't improve over time.

**What to do instead**: Track creative performance. Learn from results. Iterate on what works. Kill what doesn't. Build institutional knowledge.

---

## 12. Brand Police Overreach

**What it looks like**: Brand guidelines so rigid that no creative flexibility exists. Every deviation rejected. Guidelines that prevent good creative.

**Why it seems good**: Brand consistency. Protecting the brand. Standards matter.

**Why it fails**: Guidelines meant to enable become constraints that disable. Best creative often bends rules thoughtfully. Over-policing kills creativity and creates adversarial relationship.

**What to do instead**: Guidelines with principles, not just rules. Room for thoughtful deviation. Brand review as collaboration, not policing. Trust creative partners.

## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

*Real production issues that cause outages and bugs.*

# Creative Communications Sharp Edges

Critical mistakes that kill creative quality, waste resources, or damage brand.

---

## 1. The Vague Brief

**The mistake**: Briefing creative with unclear objectives. "We need something cool for social." "Make it pop." No target audience, no goal, no success criteria.

**Why it happens**: Strategy wasn't done. Stakeholder doesn't know what they want. Rushing to production. "Creatives will figure it out."

**Why it's devastating**: Creatives produce work that misses the mark. Multiple rounds of revisions trying to hit an undefined target. Time and money wasted. Tension between stakeholders and creative team.

**The fix**: Every brief must include: target audience, objective (what do you want them to do), key message, success criteria, constraints (budget, timeline, mandatories). No exceptions.

---

## 2. The Revision Spiral

**The mistake**: Endless rounds of changes. Each stakeholder adds feedback. Scope creeps with each round. "One more small change" becomes ten more changes.

**Why it happens**: No approval process. Too many stakeholders. Subjective feedback without clear decision-maker. Fear of commitment.

**Why it's devastating**: Deadlines missed. Creative quality degrades with over-revision. Team burns out. Costs spiral. The final product is a camel designed by committee.

**The fix**: Defined approval process with clear decision-maker. Maximum revision rounds specified upfront. Consolidated feedback (one voice to creative). Time-boxed review periods.

---

## 3. The Off-Brand Asset

**The mistake**: Creating assets that don't follow brand guidelines. Wrong logo usage, off-palette colors, inconsistent typography. Each piece looks like a different company.

**Why it happens**: Brand guidelines unclear or unavailable. Rushed production. Different vendors/freelancers each time. No brand review step.

**Why it's devastating**: Erodes brand recognition. Looks unprofessional. Undermines all the equity built in brand. Confuses customers.

**The fix**: Accessible, clear brand guidelines. Brand review as mandatory checkpoint. Templates for common asset types. Brand training for all creative contributors.

---

## 4. The Platform Mismatch

**The mistake**: Creating one asset and cramming it into every platform. TV spot cropped for Instagram Stories. Print ad repurposed for Twitter without adaptation.

**Why it happens**: Budget constraints. "We'll make it work." Don't understand platform differences.

**Why it's devastating**: Cropped visuals that miss key elements. Wrong aspect ratios. Text too small to read. Captions cut off. Looks lazy and unprofessional.

**The fix**: Design for each platform from the start. Lead platform first, then adapt (don't just resize). Understand platform constraints before creating. Platform-specific asset checklists.

---

## 5. The Uncleared Asset

**The mistake**: Using photos, music, fonts, or footage without proper licensing. Stock photos used beyond license scope. Music in video without sync rights.

**Why it happens**: Didn't check licenses. Assumed it was fine. Used temp music, then shipped it. Downloaded from Google Images.

**Why it's devastating**: Legal exposure. Takedown notices. Lawsuits from rights holders. Embarrassing removal of published content. Fines.

**The fix**: Clear rights for everything before production. Maintain asset license database. Never use "temp" assets in final work. When in doubt, don't use it.

---

## 6. The Approval Bottleneck

**The mistake**: Creative sitting in approval queue for days or weeks. Key approver unavailable. No escalation path. Deadline missed while waiting.

**Why it happens**: Unclear approval process. Approvers overloaded. No backup decision-maker. Approvals not prioritized.

**Why it's devastating**: Missed deadlines. Campaigns delayed. Creative teams blocked. Last-minute rushing when approval finally comes.

**The fix**: Defined SLAs for approval. Backup approvers for each role. Escalation process. Approval timeboxes. Tools that surface approval needs prominently.

---

## 7. The Single-Use Asset

**The mistake**: Creating expensive creative that can only be used once. Highly specific headlines, dated references, single-platform optimization.

**Why it happens**: Optimizing only for immediate use. Not thinking about reuse. Campaign-specific everything.

**Why it's devastating**: High cost per use. Constantly creating from scratch. No asset library to leverage. Inefficient creative operations.

**The fix**: Design for modularity where possible. Create master assets that can be adapted. Build asset library. Consider longevity in brief.

---

## 8. The Literal Interpretation

**The mistake**: Creative that just illustrates the product literally. Showing a laptop to sell software. Stock photos of "business people."

**Why it happens**: Safe. Easy to approve. Doesn't require creative risk. "Just show what we sell."

**Why it's devastating**: Invisible in crowded markets. Doesn't differentiate. Boring. Fails to connect emotionally. No memorability.

**The fix**: Brief for emotion and differentiation, not just depiction. Push for concepts that surprise. Show the benefit, not just the product. Take creative risks worth taking.

---

## 9. The Unfeedbackable Feedback

**The mistake**: Giving subjective, vague feedback that creative can't act on. "Make it more premium." "It needs more energy." "I'll know it when I see it."

**Why it happens**: Stakeholder can't articulate what's wrong. Don't understand creative process. Personal taste masquerading as feedback.

**Why it's devastating**: Endless rounds trying to guess what's wanted. Frustrated creative team. Wasted time. Relationship damage.

**The fix**: Train stakeholders on giving actionable feedback. "Instead of X, try Y because Z." Reference examples. Tie feedback to brief objectives. "How does this fail to achieve the stated goal?"

---

## 10. The Over-Produced Asset

**The mistake**: Creating highly polished, expensive content when low-fi would work better. Agency-quality video for organic social. Studio photography for Instagram Stories.

**Why it happens**: "Quality matters." Agency habits. Don't understand platform context. Over-investment in every asset.

**Why it's devastating**: Slow to produce. Expensive. Often outperformed by authentic, lower-production content. Wrong fit for platform.

**The fix**: Match production level to platform and purpose. Test lo-fi before committing to hi-fi. Embrace authenticity where appropriate. Production value should serve strategy, not ego.

---

## 11. The Orphan Asset

**The mistake**: Creating great creative that never gets distributed. Perfect video sitting on hard drives. Assets created but never launched.

**Why it happens**: Campaign killed. Strategy changed. Approval never came. Production finished after window closed.

**Why it's devastating**: Complete waste of resources. Demoralized creative team. Sunk costs.

**The fix**: Distribution planning before production. Launch commitment before investment. Kill projects early if strategy changes. Better to produce less that ships than more that doesn't.

---

## 12. The Translation Disaster

**The mistake**: Localizing creative poorly—literal translations that miss cultural context, imagery that doesn't resonate, or worse, offends.

**Why it happens**: Translation without cultural review. Assuming visual language is universal. Budget-constrained localization.

**Why it's devastating**: Messages that don't land. Cultural insensitivity. Brand damage in new markets. Wasted localization investment.

**The fix**: Cultural review alongside translation. Local market experts involved early. Test with target market audiences. Some concepts don't translate—create new ones.

## Decision Framework

# Creative Communications Decisions

Decision frameworks for creative production, resourcing, and quality management.

---

## 1. In-House vs Agency vs Freelance

**Context**: Who should create your creative assets.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **In-house team** | High volume, consistent needs, brand intimacy matters | Fixed cost, capacity limits, skill constraints |
| **Agency partner** | Major campaigns, specialized skills, scale flexibility | Cost, onboarding, less brand intimacy |
| **Freelance/contractors** | Specific skills, overflow capacity, budget constraints | Management overhead, consistency risk |
| **Hybrid** | Core in-house, burst capacity external | Coordination complexity, style consistency |

**Decision criteria**: Volume, complexity, budget, need for brand consistency, required skills.

**Red flags**: Agency for routine work, in-house for rare specialized needs, freelance with no quality control.

---

## 2. Production Investment Level

**Context**: How much to invest in a given piece of creative.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **High production (pro shoot, studio)** | Hero assets, major campaigns, long shelf life | Expensive, slow, high stakes |
| **Medium production (prosumer)** | Regular content, moderate visibility | Balance of quality and cost |
| **Low production (DIY, user-style)** | Social content, authenticity matters, testing | May look amateur, limited polish |
| **User-generated** | Social proof, authenticity, scale | Quality variance, rights issues |

**Decision criteria**: Visibility/importance, budget, platform context, authenticity needs.

**Red flags**: High production for ephemeral social, low production for brand campaigns, mismatched investment to impact.

---

## 3. Creative Testing Approach

**Context**: How to test and validate creative before scaling investment.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Concept testing (qual)** | Early stage, understanding why, complex ideas | Slow, small sample, doesn't predict in-market |
| **A/B testing (in-market)** | Have distribution, need quantitative signal | Needs traffic, tests execution not concept |
| **Focus groups** | Deep understanding, observe reactions | Expensive, groupthink risk, not in context |
| **Ship and measure** | Fast-moving, reversible, learning culture | Risk of failure, no pre-validation |

**Decision criteria**: Investment level, available audience, timeline, risk tolerance.

**Red flags**: No testing for major campaigns, extensive testing for low-stakes content, testing as excuse to delay.

---

## 4. Revision Round Limits

**Context**: How many rounds of feedback and revision to allow.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **One round** | Simple assets, trusted creators, tight timeline | Less polish, requires good briefs |
| **Two rounds (standard)** | Most projects, reasonable refinement | Balance of quality and efficiency |
| **Three+ rounds** | Complex/high-stakes, many stakeholders | Slow, expensive, diminishing returns |
| **Unlimited (until approved)** | Rare critical assets, perfectionism required | Scope creep, cost overruns, team burnout |

**Decision criteria**: Complexity, stakes, timeline, budget, stakeholder count.

**Red flags**: Unlimited rounds as default, one round with unclear briefs, rounds as relationship management not quality.

---

## 5. Platform Prioritization

**Context**: Which platform to design for first when creating multi-channel creative.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Highest volume/spend** | Performance marketing, clear primary channel | May not be most creative-friendly |
| **Most constrained** | Design within constraints, adapt outward | Limits creative ambition |
| **Most creative-friendly** | Hero creative, showcase quality | May not adapt well to constrained channels |
| **Simultaneous (modular)** | High-volume, system approach | Complex production, coordination heavy |

**Decision criteria**: Where most impressions/impact, creative constraints, production efficiency.

**Red flags**: Designing for print then adapting to digital, ignoring primary channel, forcing fit where it doesn't work.

---

## 6. Brand Flexibility

**Context**: How strictly to apply brand guidelines.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Strict adherence** | Core brand touchpoints, consistency critical | May limit creative expression |
| **Guided flexibility** | Campaigns within brand, thoughtful deviation | Requires judgment, review needed |
| **Channel-specific rules** | Different contexts need different treatment | Complexity, version sprawl |
| **Brand evolution moment** | Refreshing brand, testing new directions | Risk, may dilute equity |

**Decision criteria**: Brand maturity, touchpoint importance, strategic context.

**Red flags**: Rigid rules that prevent good creative, so flexible there's no brand, inconsistency without strategy.

---

## 7. Video Length Strategy

**Context**: How long video content should be.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **6-15 seconds** | Paid social, bumpers, awareness | Limited story, simple message only |
| **30-60 seconds** | Traditional spots, social ads, complete message | Higher production, attention demands |
| **2-5 minutes** | Explainers, tutorials, consideration content | Requires interest, drop-off risk |
| **Long-form (10+ min)** | Deep education, entertainment, engaged audience | Major commitment, niche use |

**Decision criteria**: Platform, objective, audience intent, distribution.

**Red flags**: Long video for interruption contexts, short video for complex explanations, ignoring platform norms.

---

## 8. Localization Approach

**Context**: How to adapt creative for different markets.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Translation only** | Text-heavy, universal visuals, budget constraints | May miss cultural nuance |
| **Transcreation** | Creative concepts need adaptation, culturally sensitive | More expensive, slower |
| **Local creation** | Market-specific needs, local expertise available | Higher cost, potential inconsistency |
| **Global creative** | Universal appeal, efficiency priority | May not resonate locally |

**Decision criteria**: Market importance, cultural distance, budget, brand flexibility.

**Red flags**: Translation for culturally specific content, local creation without brand governance, assuming universal appeal.

---

## 9. Asset Lifecycle Management

**Context**: How long creative assets should be used before refresh.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Evergreen (refresh annually)** | Core brand assets, non-trendy content | Requires timeless design |
| **Campaign-length** | Campaign-specific, dated references | Clear end, wasted investment |
| **Performance-based** | Run until performance declines | Requires monitoring, may fatigue |
| **Seasonal/event-based** | Holiday, event-tied content | Built-in expiration, annual reuse |

**Decision criteria**: Content type, performance tracking capability, refresh budget.

**Red flags**: Dated creative still running, constant refresh without performance justification, no lifecycle planning.

---

## 10. Quality Control Process

**Context**: How to ensure creative quality before publication.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Minimal (creator self-review)** | Low stakes, trusted creators, speed priority | Quality risk, errors slip through |
| **Peer review** | Moderate stakes, team structure, catch obvious issues | Time cost, still may miss things |
| **Dedicated QA** | High volume, high stakes, quality critical | Bottleneck, cost |
| **Multi-stage** | Major campaigns, multiple review types needed | Slow, complex, may over-process |

**Decision criteria**: Stakes, volume, error tolerance, resources.

**Red flags**: No QC for high-visibility content, excessive QC for low-stakes, QC as bottleneck not enabler.
