# Marketing Fundamentals

> Core marketing principles for startups. Covers positioning, messaging,
channels, and growth. Focus on what works for resource-constrained teams.

Battle scars included: I've watched startups burn $1M on Instagram ads because
"that's where competitors are", seen "growth hacks" destroy brand trust overnight,
and advised founders who scaled marketing before finding product-market fit.

Contrarian take: Most startup marketing advice is backwards. The best marketing
doesn't feel like marketing. Distribution comes before product features. And
your first 100 customers should never come from paid ads.

## Patterns

### Jobs-To-Be-Done Positioning
Position around the job customers hire your product to do
**When:** Defining positioning and messaging for a new product or market

### The Bullseye Framework
Systematic process for finding your one scalable channel
**When:** Early-stage company needs to identify best acquisition channel

### Conversion Funnel Optimization
Systematically improve each stage of customer journey
**When:** You have traffic but conversion rates are below benchmark

### Customer Development Interviews
Validate positioning and messaging before spending on marketing
**When:** Before launching campaigns or scaling spend

### North Star Metric Selection
Choose one metric that represents value delivery
**When:** Setting up measurement framework for growth team

### Cohort Retention Analysis
Track user groups over time to measure product-market fit
**When:** Understanding if you have retention issues or growth issues

### First 100 Users Playbook
Manual, unscalable tactics to find and learn from early customers
**When:** Pre-PMF, need to find initial users and validate problem

### Channel Stacking Strategy
Sequencing channels to compound growth instead of competing
**When:** One channel working, ready to add second without diluting focus

### Positioning Before Marketing
Do positioning work before spending any marketing dollars
**When:** New product, entering new market, or current marketing not working

### Distribution-First Product Design
Build distribution into the product itself, not as afterthought
**When:** Designing new features or products, especially in crowded markets


## Anti-Patterns

### Spray and Pray
Trying every channel superficially instead of mastering one
**Instead:** Pick one channel, go deep, measure properly

### Brand Before Traction
Investing in brand campaigns before product-market fit
**Instead:** Focus on direct response until PMF proven

### Build It And They Will Come
Assuming good product markets itself
**Instead:** Marketing is day one, not after launch

### Premature Scaling
Scaling marketing before message and channel validated
**Instead:** Prove unit economics at small scale first

### Copying Competitors
Using competitor tactics without understanding context
**Instead:** Find your unique angle and channel
