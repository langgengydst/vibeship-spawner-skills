## Patterns

### AI Brand Guidelines Document
**When:** Starting brand AI implementation or onboarding new AI tools

### Prompt Library Architecture
**When:** Need reusable, versioned prompts for consistent AI generation

### Visual Style Tuning Workflow
**When:** Training AI image generators on your brand aesthetic

### Voice Training Methodology
**When:** Teaching AI to write in your brand voice across contexts

### Asset Variation System
**When:** Need to generate multiple on-brand variations efficiently

### Brand Consistency Checker
**When:** Validating AI-generated content meets brand standards
```
Create AI-powered brand validation system:

## Visual Consistency Checker
Prompt for image validation:

```
You are a brand consistency validator for {BRAND}.

Brand Guidelines:
- Color palette: {COLORS}
- Typography: {FONTS}
- Visual style: {STYLE_DESCRIPTION}
- Must avoid: {NEGATIVES}

Analyze this image and check:
1. Color usage: In palette? Proportions correct?
2. Typography: Approved fonts? Proper hierarchy?
3. Style: Matches brand aesthetic? Reference images?
4. Violations: Any forbidden elements?
5. Overall: Brand-aligned? (1-10 score)

Output: Pass/Fail + specific issues + suggestions
```

## Copy Consistency Checker
Prompt for text validation:

```
You are a brand voice validator for {BRAND}.

Voice Guidelines:
- Tone: {TONE_DESCRIPTION}
- Forbidden phrases: {BLOCKLIST}
- Example corpus: {EXAMPLES}

Analyze this copy:
"{TEXT_TO_CHECK}"

Check:
1. Voice match: Sounds like brand? (1-10)
2. Forbidden phrases: Any violations?
3. Tone appropriateness: Right for {CONTEXT}?
4. Improvements: Specific suggestions to strengthen

Output: Pass/Fail + issues + rewrite suggestions
```

## Automated Workflow
Integrate checkers into approval flow:

1. AI generates content
2. Auto-run consistency checker
3. If Pass: Send to human review
4. If Fail: Show issues, suggest fixes, regenerate
5. Track failure patterns to improve base prompts

## Feedback Loop
When humans override checker (approve "fails" or reject "passes"),
capture feedback to refine validation prompts.

```

### Multi-Channel Brand Deployment
**When:** Launching brand across multiple AI-powered channels

### Brand Evolution Management
**When:** Brand needs to evolve while maintaining AI consistency
