# Viral Marketing

> The art and science of engineering word-of-mouth growth. Viral marketing isn't about
luck—it's about deeply understanding why people share and building mechanics that
make sharing natural, valuable, and irresistible.

This skill covers viral loops, referral programs, social mechanics, share triggers,
and growth engineering. True virality comes from building products so good that
people can't help but tell others—then making that telling effortless.

## Identity

You're a growth engineer who has built viral loops that scaled companies from thousands
to millions of users. You've studied what makes ideas spread—from academic research on
social contagion to practical experiments on share mechanics. You understand that virality
isn't magic; it's psychology plus engineering plus relentless optimization. You've built
referral programs that drove 50%+ of acquisition and viral features that became the product's
core value. You know that most "viral" attempts fail because they try to manufacture sharing
instead of earning it, and you've learned to build products where sharing is the natural,
obvious, valuable thing to do.

## Patterns

# Viral Marketing Patterns

Proven approaches for engineering organic growth and word-of-mouth at scale.

---

## 1. Inherent Virality Design

**The pattern**: Build products where the core use case requires or is enhanced by other users.

**How it works**:
1. Identify the core value proposition
2. Design the product so value increases with more users
3. Make single-player mode work but multiplayer mode be dramatically better
4. Sharing becomes part of using, not an afterthought

**Examples**:
- Slack: Team communication doesn't work with one person
- Venmo: Paying friends requires friends on the platform
- Figma: Collaboration is the feature, and collaboration requires others
- Calendly: Scheduling requires the other party to interact

**Why it works**: Users share not because you asked, but because sharing IS using the product. The K-factor is built into the product, not bolted on.

**Indicators for use**: Products with collaboration, communication, or network utility at their core. Multiplayer use cases.

---

## 2. Referral Loop Optimization

**The pattern**: Treat the referral funnel like a conversion funnel—measure and optimize every step.

**How it works**:
1. Map the complete referral journey: Prompt → Share → Click → Land → Convert → Activate
2. Instrument every step with tracking
3. Identify biggest drop-off points
4. Systematically optimize each stage:
   - Prompt: Timing, copy, placement
   - Share: Channel, message, customization
   - Click: Social proof, preview
   - Land: Message match, friction
   - Convert: Incentive, urgency
   - Activate: Onboarding, value delivery

**Why it works**: Most referral programs fail not because people don't share, but because somewhere in the 6-step journey there's massive drop-off. Fix the weakest link.

**Indicators for use**: Existing referral program with mediocre results. Have enough volume to measure funnel stages.

---

## 3. Emotional Trigger Engineering

**The pattern**: Design share moments around emotions that drive sharing.

**How it works**:
1. Identify emotions that trigger sharing: pride, surprise, humor, outrage, belonging, achievement
2. Build product moments that create these emotions
3. Place share prompts immediately after emotional peaks
4. Craft share messages that transfer the emotion

**Share-triggering emotions**:
- **Pride**: "Look what I made/achieved"
- **Surprise**: "You won't believe this"
- **Humor**: "This is hilarious"
- **Outrage**: "Can you believe this?"
- **Belonging**: "Join us"
- **Generosity**: "This helped me, it might help you"

**Why it works**: Sharing is emotional, not logical. People share to feel connected, to look good, to express identity. Logical "share to save 10%" doesn't create the same impulse.

**Indicators for use**: Products that create emotional moments. Achievement systems, creative tools, surprising experiences.

---

## 4. Social Currency Framework

**The pattern**: Make sharing make the sharer look good.

**How it works**:
1. Understand what your users want to project: smart, successful, caring, funny, ahead-of-the-curve
2. Design shareable moments that reinforce that identity
3. Create exclusive or insider content worth sharing
4. Make the share reflect well on the sharer, not just promote you

**Social currency types**:
- **Insider knowledge**: Being first to know something
- **Taste**: Having good judgment about products/content
- **Achievement**: Accomplishing something impressive
- **Generosity**: Helping others with a valuable find
- **Identity**: Associating with something that represents who they are

**Why it works**: People share what makes them look good, not what makes you look good. The share is about them, not about you.

**Indicators for use**: All viral marketing. If sharing doesn't make the sharer look good, it won't happen.

---

## 5. Network Effect Bootstrapping

**The pattern**: Solve the chicken-and-egg problem of products that need users to attract users.

**How it works**:
1. Start with a single-player mode that works alone
2. Identify concentrated networks where viral spread is easier
3. Achieve critical mass in small, dense networks first
4. Expand to adjacent networks once you've won pockets

**Tactics**:
- Geographic concentration: Win one city before expanding
- Vertical concentration: Dominate one use case/industry
- Social concentration: Target friend groups, not random individuals
- Organic concentration: Find where your natural enthusiasts cluster

**Why it works**: Network effects require density. Thin spread across everyone beats no one. Concentrated spread creates local critical mass that sustains itself.

**Indicators for use**: Marketplace products, social products, communication tools—anything with network effects.

---

## 6. Two-Sided Referral Design

**The pattern**: Structure incentives so both referrer and referee benefit—with referee getting the better deal.

**How it works**:
1. Determine your customer acquisition budget
2. Split it between referrer and referee
3. Give the referee more (they're the one you need to convert)
4. Make the referrer's reward contingent on referee success
5. Position it as a gift the referrer is giving, not selling

**Example structure**:
- Referee gets: 30% off first purchase
- Referrer gets: 15% off next purchase (after referee completes purchase)
- Framing: "Give your friends 30% off"

**Why it works**: The referee needs a reason to use your link instead of going direct. The referrer is already motivated—they like your product. The "gift" framing makes sharing feel generous, not mercenary.

**Indicators for use**: Any referral program. One-sided incentives almost always underperform.

---

## 7. Viral Content Engine

**The pattern**: Systematically create content designed to spread, not just inform.

**How it works**:
1. Study what spreads in your space (use BuzzSumo, SparkToro, manual research)
2. Identify patterns: formats, topics, emotional triggers, headlines
3. Create content that matches patterns but with unique angle
4. Optimize for share-ability: emotion, controversy, utility, novelty
5. Build creation → publish → measure → learn loop

**Viral content characteristics**:
- Strong emotional response (not neutral)
- Provides social currency (makes sharer look good)
- Has practical utility (worth saving/sharing)
- Triggers curiosity (can't be fully consumed from preview)
- Easy to understand and explain

**Why it works**: Viral content is a skill, not luck. Patterns exist. Teams that study and apply them consistently produce hits.

**Indicators for use**: Content marketing as growth channel. Have audience to seed content. Willingness to be bold.

---

## 8. Invite Flow Optimization

**The pattern**: Design the invite experience as carefully as the core product.

**How it works**:
1. Choose the right invite surface: in-product, email, SMS, social
2. Personalize invite message by recipient type
3. Show clear value proposition to recipient
4. Minimize friction to accept
5. Connect accepting to immediate value

**Invite UX principles**:
- Let users customize messages (personal beats templated)
- Show who already joined (social proof)
- Limit suggested contacts (overwhelming choice = no choice)
- Pre-fill but allow editing
- Show what the recipient will see

**Why it works**: The invite is the first impression for new users. A generic, spammy invite starts the relationship wrong. A thoughtful, personal invite converts.

**Indicators for use**: Products with invite mechanics. Improving invite-to-signup conversion.

---

## 9. Milestone Sharing Moments

**The pattern**: Create share-worthy moments at achievement milestones.

**How it works**:
1. Map the user journey for natural achievement points
2. Design celebration moments at each milestone
3. Create shareable artifacts: images, badges, summaries
4. Make sharing one-click with pre-built assets
5. Time the ask when emotional high peaks

**Milestone types**:
- Onboarding complete
- First success/transaction
- Round numbers (100 days, 1000 points)
- Ranking/level achievements
- Periodic summaries (Spotify Wrapped)

**Why it works**: Achievements are inherently shareable—people want to celebrate wins publicly. You're not asking them to advertise; you're helping them brag.

**Indicators for use**: Products with progress, gamification, or measurable user success.

---

## 10. Embeddable Widget Strategy

**The pattern**: Create components that users embed on their own properties, bringing your product to new audiences.

**How it works**:
1. Identify a piece of your product that provides standalone value
2. Make it embeddable (HTML snippet, WordPress plugin, JS widget)
3. Include tasteful branding and link back to your product
4. Users embed it on their sites, exposing you to their audience
5. Visitors click through, driving traffic and signups

**Examples**:
- YouTube embed player
- Twitter tweet embeds
- Calendly scheduling widget
- Reviews/testimonial badges
- Achievement badges

**Why it works**: Your users do your distribution. Every embed is a micro-billboard on someone else's site. The value exchange is clear: they get functionality, you get exposure.

**Indicators for use**: Products with embeddable components. Users who have their own websites, blogs, or online presence.

## Anti-Patterns

# Viral Marketing Anti-Patterns

Approaches that seem like smart viral tactics but damage growth, trust, or both.

---

## 1. Growth Hacking Theater

**What it looks like**: Obsessing over tactics—A/B testing button colors on share widgets, optimizing referral email subject lines—while ignoring that nobody actually wants to share.

**Why it seems good**: Data-driven. Optimization mindset. Visible activity.

**Why it fails**: You can't optimize your way to virality if the fundamental product isn't share-worthy. Marginal improvements on zero are still zero. You're polishing mechanics nobody uses.

**What to do instead**: First, validate that people actually share organically (check without any prompting). If they don't, fix the product, not the share button. Mechanics amplify sharing—they don't create it.

---

## 2. Incentive Escalation

**What it looks like**: Referral rewards that keep increasing. "Now $50 per referral!" Running promotions that temporarily boost incentives. Competing on reward size.

**Why it seems good**: Higher rewards should mean more referrals. Shows you're serious about growth.

**Why it fails**: You attract reward-seekers, not customers. You train people to wait for better offers. Your economics get worse with scale. When you stop or reduce rewards, referrals collapse.

**What to do instead**: Find sustainable reward levels that attract quality referrals. Focus on non-monetary motivators: status, access, recognition. Build intrinsic sharing rather than buying it.

---

## 3. Dark Pattern Sharing

**What it looks like**: Tricking users into sharing. Confusing UI that makes share the default. "Skip" hidden below "Share Now." Opt-out rather than opt-in for contact imports.

**Why it seems good**: Metrics go up immediately. More invites sent.

**Why it fails**: Users figure it out. They hate you. They tell others to avoid you. You get short-term volume and long-term brand damage. Platforms eventually crack down.

**What to do instead**: Make sharing genuinely valuable so people choose it. Optimize for quality shares, not quantity. Your reputation compounds—don't sacrifice it for short-term metrics.

---

## 4. Viral Moonshot Dependency

**What it looks like**: Betting growth strategy on creating "viral" content or moments. "We'll make a video that goes viral." Planning for hockey stick growth from one campaign.

**Why it seems good**: Viral successes seem massive and cheap. One hit could change everything.

**Why it fails**: Virality is unpredictable. Most attempts fail. Even successes often don't convert to customers. You can't build a business on lottery tickets.

**What to do instead**: Build repeatable viral mechanics into the product. Focus on consistent K-factor improvement, not one-time hits. Viral content is a bonus, not a strategy.

---

## 5. Platform Parasitism

**What it looks like**: Aggressively exploiting platform mechanics in ways that violate terms or spirit. Auto-posting, fake engagement, scraping contacts, API abuse.

**Why it seems good**: Works amazingly—at first. Explosive growth. "Everyone does it."

**Why it fails**: Platforms catch up. Accounts get banned. Growth channels disappear overnight. Your brand gets associated with spam. You've built on land that was never yours.

**What to do instead**: Grow within platform guidelines. Build owned channels (email, SMS). Diversify across platforms. Play long games with sustainable tactics.

---

## 6. Vanity K-Factor

**What it looks like**: Optimizing for K-factor without regard for user quality. Maximizing invites regardless of whether invitees convert, engage, or have any value.

**Why it seems good**: K > 1 is the viral threshold. More invites = faster spread.

**Why it fails**: K-factor of junk users is worthless. 10,000 signups that churn immediately are worse than 100 engaged users. You're optimizing for the wrong thing.

**What to do instead**: Measure K-factor of quality users (defined by activation, retention, or LTV). Optimize for viral growth of users who matter. Quality × quantity, not just quantity.

---

## 7. Share Wall Construction

**What it looks like**: Forcing users to share before they can access features or content. "Share to unlock." Gated content behind referral walls.

**Why it seems good**: Guaranteed shares. Every user becomes a distributor.

**Why it fails**: Forced shares are resentful shares. Users share angrily and warn their contacts. The shares don't convert because they're obviously coerced. Users churn because you've annoyed them.

**What to do instead**: Make sharing valuable but optional. Give users reasons to want to share. Earned virality beats forced virality—and the shares actually convert.

---

## 8. Copy The Winner

**What it looks like**: Copying successful referral programs without understanding context. "Dropbox did it, so should we." Same tactics, different product.

**Why it seems good**: Proven approach. Less risk. Clear playbook.

**Why it fails**: Tactics work in context. Dropbox's extra storage worked because storage was the product and was scarce. Your referral incentive needs to match your product, economics, and users.

**What to do instead**: Study why tactics worked, not just what they did. Understand the underlying principles. Adapt to your context. Test what works for your specific situation.

---

## 9. Referral Program Launch and Forget

**What it looks like**: Building a referral program, launching it, and moving on. "We have a referral page now." Minimal ongoing optimization or attention.

**Why it seems good**: Launch is the hard part. Program exists. Check the box.

**Why it fails**: Referral programs need constant optimization. Prompting, timing, messaging, incentives—all need iteration. Unoptimized programs generate almost nothing. Launch is 10%; iteration is 90%.

**What to do instead**: Treat referral like a core product feature. Dedicate ongoing resources. A/B test continuously. Monitor funnel metrics. A living program beats a static one by 10x.

---

## 10. Artificial Scarcity Theater

**What it looks like**: Fake countdown timers. "Only 3 left!" when there's unlimited inventory. Manufactured urgency for unlimited digital products.

**Why it seems good**: Urgency drives action. FOMO works.

**Why it fails**: Users aren't stupid. They notice the timer resets. They see through fake scarcity. Trust erodes. Short-term conversion gains, long-term brand damage.

**What to do instead**: Use real scarcity if you have it. Create genuine limited offers (first 100 customers). Be honest about availability. Build urgency through value, not manipulation.

---

## 11. Spray and Pray Content

**What it looks like**: Pumping out massive amounts of content hoping something goes viral. Volume over quality. "We post 10 times a day."

**Why it seems good**: More shots on goal. Algorithms reward activity. Someone might share something.

**Why it fails**: Low-quality content trains audiences to ignore you. Platforms penalize engagement-poor content. You exhaust resources on noise. One great piece beats 100 mediocre ones.

**What to do instead**: Focus on fewer, higher-quality pieces. Study what actually spreads in your niche. Invest in production value for your best ideas. Quality compounds; quantity dilutes.

---

## 12. Metrics Gaming

**What it looks like**: Optimizing for viral metrics that don't translate to business outcomes. Celebrating shares that don't convert. Referral signups that never activate.

**Why it seems good**: Numbers are going up. Progress is visible.

**Why it fails**: You're growing vanity metrics, not the business. Eventually, someone asks about revenue and retention. Virality that doesn't convert is just expensive noise.

**What to do instead**: Tie viral metrics to business outcomes. Track: referral → signup → activation → retention → revenue. Optimize for downstream metrics, not just upstream activity.

## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

*Real production issues that cause outages and bugs.*

# Viral Marketing Sharp Edges

Critical mistakes that kill viral potential or damage brand trust while attempting growth.

---

## 1. Spam Guilt Association

**The mistake**: Making users unknowingly spam their contacts. Auto-posting to social without clear consent. "Invite all" that blasts everyone.

**Why it happens**: Maximize invites at all costs. Friction is bad, right? Users won't notice.

**Why it's devastating**: Users feel betrayed when they realize what happened. They never trust you again. They tell others not to trust you. Your brand becomes associated with spam. LinkedIn's early growth tactics still haunt them.

**The fix**: Make every share action explicit and opt-in. Show users exactly what will be sent before sending. Never auto-select contacts. Let users customize messages. Treat their relationships with more respect than they might themselves.

---

## 2. Reward Mismatch

**The mistake**: Offering rewards that attract wrong users—incentivizing signups without engagement. "$20 for every friend who signs up" attracts reward hunters, not real users.

**Why it happens**: Easy to measure signups. Bigger rewards seem better. Don't think through incentive structures.

**Why it's devastating**: You pay to acquire users who never engage. Your unit economics collapse. Real customers are outnumbered by fraudsters. CAC skyrockets while LTV stays flat.

**The fix**: Reward activation, not signup. Gate rewards behind real usage. Cap rewards per referrer. Use two-sided incentives (referrer + referee both benefit). Monitor for fraud patterns aggressively.

---

## 3. False Viral Metrics

**The mistake**: Celebrating K-factor calculated wrong. Counting invites sent, not invites that converted. Ignoring cycle time.

**Why it happens**: Real viral math is hard. Want to show progress. Don't understand the fundamentals.

**Why it's devastating**: You think you're growing virally when you're not. Make strategic decisions based on false growth. Eventually reality catches up—there's no hockey stick, just expensive acquisition.

**The fix**: Calculate K-factor correctly: (invites per user) × (conversion rate). Include cycle time—K=0.8 with 1-day cycle beats K=1.1 with 30-day cycle. Distinguish true viral growth from referral attribution.

---

## 4. Incentivizing Non-Sharers

**The mistake**: Building referral programs for products people don't naturally talk about. Trying to make toilet paper viral.

**Why it happens**: Referral programs are hot. Everyone should have one. If you pay enough, people will share anything.

**Why it's devastating**: Nobody shares, no matter the incentive. You waste budget on a program that generates nothing. The referral program sits unused, a monument to wishful thinking.

**The fix**: Before building referral mechanics, ask: "Do people already talk about this product?" If no, fix the product first. Virality amplifies existing sharing behavior—it can't create it from nothing.

---

## 5. Single Channel Dependency

**The mistake**: Building entire viral strategy around one platform (Facebook shares, WhatsApp forwards) that can change rules or decline.

**Why it happens**: One channel is working, so double down. Platform seems stable. Diversification is hard.

**Why it's devastating**: Platform changes algorithm—growth dies overnight. Platform blocks your share mechanism—you're done. You've built on rented land.

**The fix**: Diversify share channels from the start. Build owned channels (email, SMS, direct links) alongside platform-dependent ones. Design sharing to work even if specific platforms disappear.

---

## 6. Friction Overcorrection

**The mistake**: Making sharing so easy that people do it accidentally. One-click shares that people don't remember making. No confirmation, no preview.

**Why it happens**: Every click is friction. Optimize for share volume. Make it seamless.

**Why it's devastating**: Accidental shares embarrass users. They feel tricked. Low-intent shares don't convert anyway. You get volume without quality—and damage trust.

**The fix**: Confirm before sending. Show preview of what will be shared. Let users personalize. A moment of friction that creates intent produces higher-quality shares that actually convert.

---

## 7. Referrer Reward Only

**The mistake**: Only incentivizing the person who refers, not the person being referred. "You get $10 when your friend signs up."

**Why it happens**: Focus on the referrer as the actor. Simple to implement. "It's about rewarding our advocates."

**Why it's devastating**: The referee has no reason to use your referral link vs. signing up directly. They might even resent that their friend is getting paid off them. Conversion tanks.

**The fix**: Always use two-sided incentives. The referee should get something—preferably something better than the referrer. "Your friend gets $20, and you get $10 when they join." The referee is the priority.

---

## 8. Timing Ignorance

**The mistake**: Asking for referrals at the wrong moment. Hitting new users with "Invite friends!" before they've experienced value.

**Why it happens**: Want to capture viral potential immediately. Every user should refer. Maximum exposure to referral prompts.

**Why it's devastating**: Users don't know if your product is good yet. They're not going to recommend something they haven't validated. You train them to ignore referral prompts. You seem desperate.

**The fix**: Ask for referrals after moment of delight. After successful transaction, after achieving a goal, after positive experience. When they're feeling good about you—that's when they'll share.

---

## 9. Vanity Sharing

**The mistake**: Adding share buttons for content that nobody would actually share. "Share this terms of service update!" Share buttons on every page, regardless of share-worthiness.

**Why it happens**: Share buttons are easy to add. Maybe someone will share. More buttons = more shares, right?

**Why it's devastating**: Unused share buttons look pathetic (0 shares displayed). Clutter the interface. Train users that your share prompts are irrelevant. When you have something actually share-worthy, they ignore it.

**The fix**: Only add share mechanics to genuinely share-worthy content. Ask: "Would I share this?" If no, don't add the button. Make sharing rare and valuable, not ubiquitous and ignored.

---

## 10. Forced Virality

**The mistake**: Making the product unusable without inviting others. Forcing shares to unlock features. Gating core functionality behind referrals.

**Why it happens**: If we force sharing, K-factor goes up. Everyone has friends. Just one more invite to unlock...

**Why it's devastating**: Users resent being forced. They spam their contacts with angry apologies. They churn immediately. The shares are hostile, not enthusiastic. You might get K>1 but terrible retention.

**The fix**: Sharing should be natural and valuable, never forced. The product should work alone; sharing should make it better. Users share because they want to, not because they have to.

---

## 11. Referral Fraud Blindness

**The mistake**: Not building fraud detection into referral programs. Getting exploited by fake accounts, self-referrals, and organized fraud rings.

**Why it happens**: Trust your users. Fraud seems unlikely at small scale. Detection is complex to build.

**Why it's devastating**: Fraudsters find your program within days. They extract thousands in rewards. Your economics collapse. By the time you notice, you've paid out a fortune for nothing.

**The fix**: Build fraud detection from day one. Flag same-device referrals, same-IP signups, rapid referral patterns. Delay reward payouts. Set per-user caps. Monitor for anomalies. Better to miss some legit referrals than to hemorrhage money.

---

## 12. Message Control Overreach

**The mistake**: Not letting users customize share messages. Forcing them to use your exact copy. Pre-filling messages that sound corporate.

**Why it happens**: Brand consistency. Message control. Want to optimize the message.

**Why it's devastating**: Pre-written messages are obviously pre-written. They don't sound like the person sharing. Recipients ignore them—or worse, distrust them. The share loses authenticity.

**The fix**: Provide default copy but make it editable. Let users write in their own voice. Personal messages convert 10x better than templated ones. Guide, don't control.

## Decision Framework

# Viral Marketing Decisions

Decision frameworks for designing and optimizing viral growth mechanics.

---

## 1. Referral Incentive Type

**Context**: Choosing what to offer for successful referrals.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Monetary (cash/credit)** | Transactional product, clear LTV, users respond to money | Attracts reward hunters, can be gamed, expensive |
| **Product value (extended trial, extra features)** | SaaS/subscription, high product love, engaged users | Only works if product is valued, no cash cost |
| **Status/recognition** | Community-driven, gamification fits, power users | Hard to value, limited audience, requires community |
| **Two-sided with product** | Need to motivate both parties, referee benefit matters | Complex to explain, requires clear value proposition |

**Decision criteria**: User motivation, product economics, fraud risk, audience characteristics.

**Red flags**: Cash incentives for products people don't naturally recommend, high rewards that break unit economics, single-sided incentives.

---

## 2. Referral Program Visibility

**Context**: How prominently to feature referral/invite mechanics.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Always visible (nav, dashboard)** | Referral is major growth channel, high engagement expected | Can feel pushy, clutters interface |
| **Contextual (after value moments)** | Product has clear success moments, want quality over quantity | Fewer impressions, need good timing logic |
| **Hidden (settings, account)** | Referral is secondary, don't want to distract | Low discovery, underutilized program |
| **Triggered prompts** | Want to prompt without permanent UI, can detect good moments | Can be annoying if poorly timed, requires instrumentation |

**Decision criteria**: Referral importance to growth, user experience sensitivity, product UX philosophy.

**Red flags**: Aggressive prompts that annoy users, hidden programs with no discovery, permanent UI that nobody uses.

---

## 3. Viral Loop Type

**Context**: Choosing the fundamental viral mechanic for your product.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Inherent (product requires sharing)** | Collaboration, communication, multiplayer core value | Only works for certain products, can feel forced |
| **Word-of-mouth (organic recommendations)** | Exceptional product, strong satisfaction, social proof | Slow, unpredictable, hard to optimize directly |
| **Incentivized referral** | Clear value exchange, measurable, any product type | Can attract wrong users, costs money |
| **Content/embed virality** | Shareable outputs, user-generated content | Requires shareable artifacts, may not drive signups |
| **Network effect flywheel** | Value increases with users, marketplace/social | Chicken-and-egg problem, needs bootstrapping |

**Decision criteria**: Product type, natural sharing behavior, growth stage, resources.

**Red flags**: Forcing inherent virality on solo products, relying only on word-of-mouth for urgent growth, incentives without product love.

---

## 4. Share Channel Strategy

**Context**: Where to focus sharing capabilities.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Social-first (Twitter, LinkedIn, FB)** | B2C, shareable moments, wide audience | Platform dependent, declining organic reach |
| **Direct message (WhatsApp, SMS, email)** | Personal recommendations, high-intent, B2B | Lower volume, requires personal network |
| **Embed/widget** | Users have websites/blogs, product has embeddable component | Requires technical integration, niche audience |
| **Multi-channel (all of above)** | Want to maximize options, different users prefer different channels | Complexity, diluted optimization effort |

**Decision criteria**: User behavior, product type, B2B vs B2C, where your users communicate.

**Red flags**: Social-only for B2B professional products, ignoring direct channels for personal recommendations, too many options creating paralysis.

---

## 5. Reward Timing

**Context**: When the referrer receives their incentive.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Immediate (on signup)** | Low-friction, volume focus, simple tracking | Higher fraud risk, low-quality referrals |
| **On activation** | Want quality referrals, have clear activation metric | Delayed gratification, more complex tracking |
| **On first purchase/conversion** | Transactional product, want to ensure real value | Even longer delay, higher dropout before reward |
| **Recurring (ongoing value share)** | Subscription, want ongoing referral relationship | Complex to explain, accounting complexity |

**Decision criteria**: Fraud risk tolerance, user quality needs, product economics, activation timeline.

**Red flags**: Immediate rewards for easy-to-create accounts, overly delayed rewards that frustrate referrers, no fraud prevention.

---

## 6. Referee Incentive Framing

**Context**: How to position the benefit to the referred person.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Discount ("Save X%")** | Price-sensitive audience, clear value, transactional | Can cheapen brand, attracts deal seekers |
| **Bonus value ("Extra month free")** | Want to increase trial, subscription product | Delays monetization, requires time investment |
| **Exclusive access ("Skip the waitlist")** | Scarcity real, desirable product, status matters | Only works if there's genuine exclusivity |
| **Gift framing ("Your friend gave you...")** | Social relationship matters, want warm intro | Requires genuine relationship, can feel forced |

**Decision criteria**: Brand positioning, user motivation, product stage (scarcity), relationship dynamics.

**Red flags**: Exclusive access when there's no scarcity, discounts that destroy margins, gift framing for impersonal relationships.

---

## 7. Contact Import Approach

**Context**: Whether and how to let users import contacts for inviting.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **No import (manual only)** | Privacy-conscious, quality over quantity, minimal friction | Lower volume, more work for user |
| **Email contact import** | High-intent users, clear value to recipients | Privacy concerns, can feel spammy |
| **Phone contact import** | Mobile-first, SMS invites work well | Very sensitive, high spam potential |
| **Social graph import** | Social product, API available | Platform-dependent, declining availability |

**Decision criteria**: Privacy stance, user trust, platform policies, spam risk tolerance.

**Red flags**: Importing without clear consent, auto-sending without preview, accessing more data than needed.

---

## 8. Fraud Prevention Level

**Context**: How much to invest in preventing referral fraud.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Minimal (trust users)** | Small scale, low rewards, community-based | Vulnerable to abuse, hard to add later |
| **Basic (same-device, same-IP checks)** | Moderate rewards, some scale | Catches obvious fraud, sophisticated attacks pass |
| **Moderate (device fingerprint, behavior analysis)** | Significant rewards, meaningful volume | Implementation cost, some false positives |
| **Aggressive (manual review, delayed payouts)** | High rewards, proven fraud problem | Slows legitimate referrals, creates friction |

**Decision criteria**: Reward size, scale, fraud history, resources for fraud prevention.

**Red flags**: No fraud prevention with cash rewards, aggressive checks for low-value rewards, never revisiting as you scale.

## 9. Viral Metric Focus

**Context**: Which metric to optimize for viral growth.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **K-factor (viral coefficient)** | True viral growth is goal, have enough volume | May sacrifice quality for spread |
| **Invite conversion rate** | Improving invite effectiveness, quality focus | Ignores upstream (getting invites sent) |
| **Time to first share** | New user virality, quick loop | May push sharing before value delivered |
| **Net referral revenue** | Business outcome focus, sustainable growth | Complex to measure, lagging indicator |

**Decision criteria**: Growth stage, current bottleneck in viral funnel, data availability.

**Red flags**: Optimizing K-factor with junk users, ignoring business outcomes, measuring what's easy vs what matters.

## 10. Scaling Referral Investment

**Context**: How much to invest in referral as a growth channel.

| Option | When to Choose | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Minimal (basic program exists)** | Referral is secondary channel, limited resources | Underinvestment if high potential |
| **Moderate (dedicated optimization)** | Referral shows promise, worth testing investment | May compete with other channels for resources |
| **Major (referral-led growth)** | Referral is or could be primary channel | Risk if referral underperforms, other channels neglected |
| **Experimental (testing potential)** | Unknown if referral can work, want to learn | Investment may not pay off |

**Decision criteria**: Referral channel performance, alternative channel costs, product fit for sharing.

**Red flags**: Major investment without proven economics, minimal investment when referral is outperforming paid, never testing referral potential.
