## Patterns

# Patterns: Creative Strategy

Proven creative patterns that build memorable, effective campaigns.

---

## Pattern 1: The Tension Framework

**Context:** Creating compelling creative by identifying and leveraging tensions.

**The Pattern:**
```
PRINCIPLE:
Great creative lives in tension.
The space between what is and what could be.
The gap between expectation and reality.

TENSION TYPES:

Cultural Tension:
What society says vs. what people feel
Example: "You should be happy" vs. "I'm struggling"
Nike: Just Do It (action vs. excuses)

Category Tension:
What the category promises vs. what it delivers
Example: "Insurance gives peace of mind" vs. "Insurance is confusing"
Geico: So easy a caveman could do it

Personal Tension:
What people want vs. what stops them
Example: "I want to travel" vs. "I can't afford it"
Airbnb: Belong anywhere (not just afford)

FINDING TENSION:
1. What does the audience say they want?
2. What actually stops them?
3. Where is the gap?
4. What truth is unspoken?

USING TENSION:
Identify the tension → Dramatize it → Resolve with brand

Example:
Tension: People want to be fit but hate exercise
Dramatize: Show the struggle honestly
Resolve: Our product makes it enjoyable

TENSION TEST:
Does your creative acknowledge a truth?
Is there something at stake?
Is there a gap to bridge?
```

## Pattern 2: The Single-Minded Proposition

**Context:** Distilling complex offerings into one memorable idea.

**The Pattern:**
```
PRINCIPLE:
One idea, clearly expressed.
The simpler the idea, the stronger the execution.

SMP FORMULA:
For [audience], [brand] is the [frame of reference]
that [single benefit] because [reason to believe].

EXAMPLE:
For busy professionals,
Slack is the communication tool
that reduces email overload
because it organizes conversations by topic.

SMP = "Where work happens"
(Simpler, more memorable, still true)

GETTING TO SINGLE-MINDED:

Start with many benefits:
- Saves time
- Reduces email
- Easy to use
- Integrates with tools
- Fun to use
- Great on mobile

Find the core:
What do all of these ladder up to?
→ Work flows better

Express simply:
"Where work happens"

SMP TESTS:
1. Is it one thing? (not "and")
2. Is it true? (provable)
3. Is it different? (not category generic)
4. Is it simple? (one sentence)
5. Is it inspiring? (creatives can run with it)

BAD SMP:
"The best, most innovative solution for
all your productivity needs"
(Multiple ideas, generic, not ownable)

GOOD SMP:
"Just do it" (one idea, clear, ownable)
"Think different" (one idea, clear, ownable)
"The ultimate driving machine" (one benefit)
```

---

## Pattern 3: The Unexpected Juxtaposition

**Context:** Creating memorable creative through surprising combinations.

**The Pattern:**
```
PRINCIPLE:
Surprise creates memory.
Unexpected combinations force attention.
Juxtaposition reveals new meaning.

TYPES OF JUXTAPOSITION:

Visual unexpected:
Luxury brand + industrial setting
Tech product + natural environment
Serious message + playful execution

Tonal unexpected:
Serious topic + humor
Simple product + epic treatment
Corporate brand + raw authenticity

Contextual unexpected:
Product in unexpected place
Brand doing unexpected thing
Message in unexpected format

EXAMPLES:

Apple: Silhouettes dancing (music player + movement)
Dollar Shave Club: CEO in warehouse (premium quality + casual)
Old Spice: Absurdist scenarios (boring category + weird)

CREATING JUXTAPOSITION:

1. List brand associations
   What people expect from you
   Category norms
   Visual conventions

2. List opposites
   For each expectation, opposite
   What would surprise?

3. Find meaningful combinations
   Which juxtapositions reveal truth?
   Which enhance the message?

4. Execute with commitment
   Juxtaposition works when committed
   Half-measures feel confused

JUXTAPOSITION TEST:
Is it surprising?
Does it reveal something new?
Does it connect to the brand truth?
```

---

## Pattern 4: The Story Arc

**Context:** Structuring creative with classic narrative principles.

**The Pattern:**
```
PRINCIPLE:
Humans are wired for story.
Narrative creates emotional engagement.
Structure creates satisfaction.

STORY STRUCTURE:

Three-Act Structure:
ACT 1: Setup (world, character, problem)
ACT 2: Conflict (obstacles, journey)
ACT 3: Resolution (transformation, ending)

Applied to 30-second spot:
0-5s: Hook + setup
5-20s: Conflict/journey
20-28s: Resolution
28-30s: Brand + CTA

Hero's Journey (simplified):
1. Ordinary world
2. Call to adventure
3. Challenges faced
4. Transformation
5. Return changed

Applied to brand story:
1. Customer before
2. Problem emerges
3. Solution discovered
4. Using product
5. Customer after (transformed)

STORY ELEMENTS:
Character: Someone to root for
Conflict: Something at stake
Change: Transformation happens
Resolution: Satisfying ending

STORY PRINCIPLES:
Show, don't tell
Conflict creates interest
Emotion before information
End on the feeling

VIDEO STRUCTURE:
Hook (0-3s): Grab attention
Setup (3-10s): Establish context
Journey (10-25s): Build interest
Payoff (25-end): Deliver + brand
```

---

## Pattern 5: The Platform-Native Creative

**Context:** Creating content that feels native to each platform.

**The Pattern:**
```
PRINCIPLE:
Content should feel like it belongs.
Platform context shapes perception.
Native feels welcome, ads feel intrusive.

PLATFORM-NATIVE PRINCIPLES:

TikTok Native:
- Vertical, phone-shot aesthetic
- Real people, not actors
- Trending sounds/formats
- First frame hooks
- Captions always
- Feels like user content

Instagram Native:
- Aesthetic-first
- Beautiful visuals
- Lifestyle context
- Curated feel

LinkedIn Native:
- Professional context
- Insight over entertainment
- Personal stories work
- Business value clear

- Conversation starter
- Punchy, quotable
- Debate-friendly
- Real-time relevant

ADAPTATION PROCESS:
1. Understand platform culture
2. Study what works natively
3. Adapt brand to platform
4. Don't just resize - rethink

NATIVE CHECKLIST:
□ Would this feel natural in feed?
□ Does it match platform tone?
□ Is it right format/length?
□ Does it invite platform behavior?
```

---

```

---

## Pattern 7: The Emotional Ladder

**Context:** Connecting functional benefits to emotional payoffs.

**The Pattern:**
```
PRINCIPLE:
People buy emotions, justify with logic.
Ladder from features to feelings.
The higher you go, the more memorable.

THE LADDER:

FEATURES (bottom)
"What it has"
↓
FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS
"What it does for you"
↓
EMOTIONAL BENEFITS
"How it makes you feel"
↓
VALUES/IDENTITY (top)
"Who you become"

EXAMPLE LADDER:

Product: Running shoes

Feature:
Carbon fiber plate

Functional benefit:
Makes you run faster

Emotional benefit:
Feel like a real athlete

Value/Identity:
I'm someone who doesn't quit

CREATIVE LEVELS:
Feature creative: "New carbon plate technology!"
Functional creative: "Run 4% faster"
Emotional creative: "Chase your best self"
Identity creative: "Just do it"

LADDERING EXERCISE:
1. List all features
2. For each: What does it DO for them?
3. For each: How does it make them FEEL?
4. For all: What does it make them BECOME?

RULE:
The higher you ladder, the more emotional.
But: Must be credible. Must connect to product.
Don't ladder so high you lose the product.
```

---

## Pattern 8: The Campaign System

**Context:** Creating a flexible system that enables multiple executions.

**The Pattern:**
```
PRINCIPLE:
Great campaigns are systems, not one-offs.
Flexible structure + consistent idea.
Many expressions from one platform.

CAMPAIGN SYSTEM COMPONENTS:

Campaign Platform:
The core idea that can flex
Expressed in a line, visual, or format
Must be extendable

Campaign Line:
The verbal expression
Can work across executions
Memorable, ownable

Visual System:
The look that's consistent
Can adapt to any format
Instantly recognizable

Executional Format:
The repeatable structure
Same format, different content
Template for variations

EXAMPLE: "JUST DO IT"

Platform: Celebrating action over excuses
Line: "Just Do It"
Visual: Iconic athletes + stark typography
Format: [Challenge] + [Action] + "Just Do It"

Executions:
- Marathon runner: Different execution, same platform
- Everyday athlete: Different execution, same platform
- Comeback story: Different execution, same platform

SYSTEM BENEFITS:
- Efficient production
- Consistent impact
- Easy to extend
- Fresh yet familiar

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
□ Core idea works across media
□ Line/visual is ownable
□ Format is repeatable
□ Room for variety
□ Not limiting
```

---

## Pattern 9: The Strategic Insight

**Context:** Grounding creative in human truth that connects to brand.

**The Pattern:**
```
PRINCIPLE:
Insight is the bridge between audience and brand.
Human truth that the brand can own.
Not data, but understanding.

INSIGHT ANATOMY:

Observation: What you see
"People spend hours scrolling social media"

Understanding: Why they do it
"They're looking for connection and escape"

Tension: What's in the way
"But they end up feeling more lonely"

Opportunity: Where brand fits
"Help them find real connection"

INSIGHT FORMULA:
"[Audience] struggles with [tension] because
[underlying truth], which means [brand opportunity]"

INSIGHT EXAMPLES:

Observation: Parents take many photos
Understanding: They're trying to hold onto childhood
Tension: Photos pile up unseen
Insight: "Memories aren't made to be stored, they're made to be shared"
Brand: Google Photos (automatic sharing, resurfacing)

Observation: People buy premium coffee
Understanding: They want a moment of indulgence
Tension: Mornings are chaotic
Insight: "The morning coffee ritual is the one moment that's mine"
Brand: Nespresso (ritualize the moment)

FINDING INSIGHTS:
- Qualitative research
- Observation of behavior
- Cultural trends
- Social listening
- Customer conversations
- Personal experience

INSIGHT TEST:
Is it true? (validated)
Is it motivating? (leads to action)
Is it ownable? (fits our brand)
Is it fresh? (not obvious)
```

---

## Pattern 10: The Production Tiering

**Context:** Right-sizing production investment to business need.

**The Pattern:**
```
PRINCIPLE:
Not all content needs equal investment.
Match production to purpose.
Efficiency enables quantity.

PRODUCTION TIERS:

TIER 1: LO-FI ($0-5K)
Purpose: Testing, social, speed
Production: In-house, iPhone, stock
Timeline: Days
When: Testing messages, social content,
       quick turnaround, experimental

TIER 2: MID-FI ($5-25K)
Purpose: Proven concepts, regular content
Production: Small crew, 1-day shoot
Timeline: 2-4 weeks
When: Product videos, testimonials,
       social campaigns, standard content

TIER 3: HI-FI ($25-100K)
Purpose: Key campaigns, brand content
Production: Full crew, multi-day
Timeline: 6-8 weeks
When: Brand videos, major campaigns,
       competitive moments

TIER 4: PREMIUM ($100K+)
Purpose: Brand-defining moments
Production: Agency + production company
Timeline: Months
When: Super Bowl, launch campaigns,
       company pivots, rare moments

TIER SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Business importance
- Shelf life of content
- Audience reach
- Brand exposure level
- Budget available
- Timeline required

EFFICIENT PRODUCTION:
Shoot for multiple tiers at once
Create tier 2-3 on same shoot
Break hero into social cuts
Template repeatable formats
Build production muscle
```

## Anti-Patterns

# Anti-Patterns: Creative Strategy

These approaches look like smart creative strategies but consistently fail to connect.

---

## 1. The Award Bait

**The Mistake:**
```
Creative meeting:
"This could win at Cannes!"
"Let's push the boundaries!"
"Awards will raise our profile!"

Creates:
Edgy, attention-grabbing creative
That doesn't sell anything
That the target audience doesn't see
That wins awards for the agency

Result:
Trophies on shelf
Zero business impact
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Awards reward creativity, not effectiveness
- Award shows have different audiences
- Ego-driven, not business-driven
- Can damage brand if off-target

**Better Approach:**
```
EFFECTIVENESS-FIRST CREATIVE:

Before creating, ask:
1. What business outcome do we need?
2. Who needs to do what?
3. How will we measure success?

Creative should be:
- Effective first
- Memorable second
- Award-worthy as bonus

AWARD REALITY:
Some award-winning work is effective.
Much effective work isn't award-winning.
Chase effectiveness; awards may follow.

EFFECTIVENESS METRICS:
- Brand lift (awareness, consideration)
- Sales impact (conversions, revenue)
- Behavioral change (actions taken)
- Business outcomes (real results)
```

---

## 2. The Template Trap

**The Mistake:**
```
"What are competitors doing?"
"What's working in our category?"
"Let's do something like [successful campaign]"

Creates:
Same category visual language
Same messaging approach
Same formats and tactics

Result:
Blends with everything else
Not distinctive
Forgettable
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Category norms create sea of sameness
- Distinctiveness is key to memory
- Following ≠ leading
- No competitive advantage

**Better Approach:**
```
DISTINCTIVE CREATIVE:

Category audit:
What does everyone in category do?
What visual clichés exist?
What tone is standard?

Then: Do something different.

DISTINCTIVENESS RULES:
1. If category is serious, can you be playful?
2. If category is visual, can you be textual?
3. If category is loud, can you be quiet?
4. If everyone uses photography, use illustration?
5. If everyone uses blue, use orange?

NOT DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT'S SAKE:
Different + relevant = distinctive
Different + irrelevant = weird

DISTINCTIVE ASSETS:
Build ownable:
- Colors
- Sounds
- Characters
- Visual style
- Verbal style
That only you own.
```

---

## 3. The Focus Group Hostage

**The Mistake:**
```
Research results:
"32% preferred version A"
"Concept B tested highest on clarity"
"Respondents suggested adding..."

Creative becomes:
Frankenstein of research findings
All edges removed
Nothing to dislike
Nothing to love
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Focus groups measure preference, not prediction
- Respondents don't know what they want
- Research kills surprise
- Consensus produces mediocrity

**Better Approach:**
```
RESEARCH ROLE:
Research should INFORM, not DECIDE.

USE RESEARCH FOR:
- Understanding audience
- Testing comprehension
- Identifying confusion
- Checking for red flags

DON'T USE RESEARCH FOR:
- Making creative decisions
- Choosing between ideas
- Removing creative risk
- Justifying safe choices

RESEARCH REALITY:
People said no to:
- Red Bull ("tastes like medicine")
- Baileys ("sounds disgusting")
- iPod ("too expensive")

Research killed:
- Bold ideas
- Surprising concepts
- Category-breaking work

CREATIVE CONVICTION:
Trust informed instinct
Test for deal-breakers only
Don't design by committee
Ship with conviction
```

---

## 4. The Celebrity Crutch

**The Mistake:**
```
Creative problem:
"How do we get attention?"

Solution:
"Let's get a celebrity!"

Execution:
Celebrity holds product
Celebrity says line
Celebrity... that's it

Result:
Remember celebrity
Forget brand
Expensive licensing
No brand building
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Celebrity doesn't transfer to brand
- Expensive without brand building
- Celebrity takes the attention
- Not ownable (they do many ads)

**Better Approach:**
```
CELEBRITY USAGE RULES:

Use celebrity WHEN:
- Authentic connection to brand
- Celebrity uses/loves product
- Adds to the story (not IS the story)
- Long-term partnership (not one-off)

GOOD CELEBRITY USE:
Michael Jordan + Nike (authentic athlete)
Ryan Reynolds + Aviation Gin (owns the brand)
George Clooney + Nespresso (genuine user)

BAD CELEBRITY USE:
Random celebrity + holds product
Famous face + reads script
Expensive name + no connection

CELEBRITY QUESTIONS:
1. Would this work without the celebrity?
2. Does celebrity add or distract?
3. Is connection authentic?
4. Is it long-term or transactional?

ALTERNATIVE:
Build characters you own
Create distinctive brand assets
Develop mascots or spokespersons
Invest in brand, not rented fame
```

---

## 5. The Shock Value

**The Mistake:**
```
Creative strategy:
"Let's be provocative!"
"This will get people talking!"
"Controversy creates attention!"

Creates:
Shocking imagery
Controversial messaging
Edgy for edgy's sake

Result:
Gets attention
Creates backlash
Damages brand trust
People remember controversy, not brand
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Shock wears off
- Negative associations stick
- Trust is hard to rebuild
- Attention ≠ affinity

**Better Approach:**
```
PROVOCATIVE VS RELEVANT:

Provocative for purpose:
- Challenges status quo (relevant)
- Points out truth (valuable)
- Sparks important conversation (meaningful)

Provocative for attention:
- Shocks without substance
- Offends without purpose
- Gets attention without building brand

RULE:
Be provocative about something MEANINGFUL.
Challenge conventions that deserve challenging.
Not: shock for shock's sake.

EXAMPLES:
Good provocative:
Dove: Real beauty (challenges beauty standards)
Nike: Kaepernick (takes a stand)

Bad provocative:
Pepsi: Kendall Jenner (trivializes movements)
Various: Offensive ads (shock without purpose)

PROVOCATIVE TEST:
What are we challenging?
Why does it matter?
Does the brand have the right?
Will this build or damage trust?
```

---

## 6. The Deck-to-Creative Gap

**The Mistake:**
```
Strategy presentation:
Beautiful, 100-page deck
Incredible insights
Profound strategy
Standing ovation

Creative execution:
Generic ad
Misses the strategy
Different from deck entirely
"That's not what we sold"
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Strategy wasted
- No creative translation
- Deck theater
- Disconnect between phases

**Better Approach:**
```
STRATEGY → CREATIVE BRIDGE:

Close the gap:
1. Strategists and creatives together
   Not: Strategy throws over wall

2. Strategy in plain language
   Not: Jargon that needs translation

3. Creative territories in strategy
   Show how it could come to life
   Not: Abstract concepts only

4. Single-minded brief
   One page, clear direction
   Not: 100 pages of thinking

BRIEF ESSENTIALS:
What's the ONE thing?
Who's the audience?
What do we want them to DO?
Why would they care?

STRATEGY REVIEW:
Does creative deliver the strategy?
Does creative feel like the deck?
Would strategists recognize it?
Is the insight visible?
```

---

## 7. The Recency Bias

**The Mistake:**
```
"Did you see what [brand] just did?"
"Let's do something like that!"
"That campaign is everywhere!"

Creates:
Copy of recent successful work
Reference to trending thing
Me-too creative

Result:
Late to the trend
Not original
Already been done better
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Copying is always second
- References age quickly
- You're not that brand
- Trend already peaked

**Better Approach:**
```
INSPIRATION VS IMITATION:

Inspiration:
Learn principles from great work
Understand WHY it worked
Apply insights to your situation

Imitation:
Copy the execution
Reference the specifics
Try to recreate the magic

ORIGINAL CREATION:
Look at great work, then:
1. What's the principle?
2. How does that apply to us?
3. What's OUR version of that insight?
4. Create original expression

TREND AWARENESS:
Know what's happening
Don't just follow
Lead or sit out
Don't be fast follower

CREATIVE REFERENCES:
Old references = timeless
New references = dated fast
Best: No references, original idea
```

---

## 8. The Over-Explanation

**The Mistake:**
```
Client: "Will they understand?"
Creative adds: Explanation
Client: "But what about..."
Creative adds: More context
Client: "Make sure they get..."
Creative adds: Voiceover explaining everything

Result:
No mystery
No engagement
No thinking required
Boring
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Audience engagement requires participation
- Over-explanation insults intelligence
- Mystery creates memory
- Less is more

**Better Approach:**
```
SHOW, DON'T TELL:

Instead of:
"Our product makes mornings easier"
Show: Peaceful morning with product

Instead of:
"We care about the environment"
Show: Environmental action

Instead of:
"Our customers love us"
Show: Customer using product joyfully

CREATIVE TRUST:
Trust the audience to get it
Leave room for interpretation
Create intrigue
Reward attention

ENGAGEMENT LEVELS:
Spoon-fed: "Here's what to think"
Engaged: "Here's a clue, you figure it out"
Too cryptic: "I have no idea what this means"

TARGET: Engaged
```

---

## 9. The Executional Fixation

**The Mistake:**
```
Creative brief: Strong strategy
Initial concept: Bold idea
Review 1: "What about making it..."
Review 2: "Could we try..."
Review 3: "Let's also add..."
Review 10: Completely different

Result:
Original idea lost
Execution wandered
Committee creation
Nobody's vision
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Endless iteration kills ideas
- Execution details distract from concept
- Original insight gets lost
- Design by committee

**Better Approach:**
```
PROTECT THE IDEA:

Big idea > Execution details
Get the idea right first
Then: Execution craft

REVIEW STRUCTURE:
Round 1: Strategy and concept
Round 2: Refinement of chosen direction
Round 3: Execution craft
DONE.

Not: Infinite rounds rethinking everything

STAYING ON BRIEF:
Every review: "Does this deliver the strategy?"
Not: "What do I personally prefer?"

CREATIVE KILLS:
Sometimes idea is wrong. Kill it.
But: Kill decisively, not slowly.
Fast fail > slow death.

PROTECTION PHRASES:
"Does this note serve the strategy?"
"How does this make it more effective?"
"Is this refinement or redirection?"
```

---

## 10. The Platform Afterthought

**The Mistake:**
```
Creates: Hero video for TV
Then: "Resize for social"
Team: Crops to square
Result: Doesn't work

Creates: Magazine print ad
Then: "Make it digital"
Team: Adds animation
Result: Still feels print

Platform consideration: Zero
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Each platform is its own medium
- Resizing ≠ adapting
- Behavior differs by platform
- Native wins, forced loses

**Better Approach:**
```
PLATFORM-FIRST THINKING:

Before creating:
Where will this live?
How does audience behave there?
What does native look like?

PLATFORM CREATION:
Not: Create hero → adapt
But: Create for each platform

PLATFORM PRINCIPLES:
TikTok: Entertaining, native feel
Instagram: Beautiful, curated
YouTube: Value, subscribe
LinkedIn: Professional, insightful
TV: Story, production value

ADAPTATION PROCESS:
1. Core idea (platform agnostic)
2. Platform expression (native)
3. Create specifically for each
4. Not: Resize and force
```

---

## 11. The Music Video Fantasy

**The Mistake:**
```
Creative vision:
Cinematic opening
Slow motion beauty
Epic music swells
Gorgeous everything

Result:
Absolutely stunning
No idea what it's selling
No message communicated
Beautiful irrelevance
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Beautiful without purpose
- Form over function
- Ego project
- No brand connection

**Better Approach:**
```
PURPOSEFUL PRODUCTION:

Production value serves:
- Message clarity
- Emotional resonance
- Brand building
- Business goals

Not:
- Creative ego
- Award reel
- Director's vision
- Beauty for its own sake

PRODUCTION QUESTION:
"Does higher production value make this
more effective, or just prettier?"

EFFECTIVE BEAUTIFUL:
Apple: Beautiful AND clear
Nike: Epic AND purposeful
Airbnb: Cinematic AND story

JUST BEAUTIFUL:
[Most unsuccessful ads]
Pretty but forgettable
Aesthetic but meaningless
```

---

## 12. The One-Format Wonder

**The Mistake:**
```
Campaign:
1 video
Done.

No:
- Social adaptations
- Static versions
- Different lengths
- Different platforms
- Extended content
- Refresh plan
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Single touchpoint insufficient
- Reach requires repetition
- Different contexts need different formats
- Campaign ≠ asset

**Better Approach:**
```
CAMPAIGN ECOSYSTEM:

From one concept, create:
- Hero video (15s, 30s, 60s)
- Social cuts (platform-specific)
- Static frames (key moments)
- Carousel content (story sequence)
- Stories versions (vertical)
- Long-form (extended story)
- OOH (outdoor adaptations)
- Digital display (banners)
- Audio (radio/podcast)

PRODUCTION PLANNING:
Shoot: Capture for all formats
Edit: Create full asset library
Deliver: Complete ecosystem

CAMPAIGN DURABILITY:
Launch: Hero + launch assets
Sustain: Supporting content
Refresh: New executions, same campaign
Extend: Additional stories

SYSTEM THINKING:
Not: One video and done
But: A system of expressions
```

## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

*Real production issues that cause outages and bugs.*

# Sharp Edges: Creative Strategy

Critical mistakes that waste creative investment and fail to connect with audiences.

---

## 1. The Committee Creative

**Severity:** Critical
**Situation:** Too many stakeholders diluting the creative vision
**Why Dangerous:** Design by committee produces mediocre work.

```
THE TRAP:
Creative review:
- CEO: "Make the logo bigger"
- Sales: "Add more features"
- Legal: "Soften that claim"
- Product: "Include the roadmap"
- Finance: "Can we do it cheaper?"
- Everyone: "What if we also..."

Result:
Watered-down creative
Nobody loves it
Nobody hates it
Nobody remembers it

THE REALITY:
Great creative requires vision
Vision requires singular ownership
Committees protect, not create

THE FIX:
1. Clear creative leadership
   One person owns the vision
   Stakeholders inform, not decide

2. Brief before concepting
   Align on strategy upfront
   Debate strategy, not execution

3. Feedback protocol
   Evaluate against brief
   "Does it meet the objective?"
   Not: "Do I personally like it?"

4. Kill committees
   Small creative team
   Trusted reviewers only
   Final decider identified

REVIEW QUESTION:
"Does this deliver the strategy?"
Not: "What does everyone think?"
```

---

## 2. The Feature Film Syndrome

**Severity:** High
**Situation:** Treating every piece of creative like an epic production
**Why Dangerous:** Slow, expensive, and often unnecessary.

```
THE TRAP:
"We need a brand video!"

Process:
- 6-week discovery
- Creative agency pitch
- 4 rounds of scripting
- Location scouting
- 2-day shoot
- 6-week edit
- Multiple review rounds

Budget: $150,000
Timeline: 4 months
Result: Beautiful video nobody watches

THE REALITY:
Most creative needs:
- Speed over perfection
- Good enough over great
- More versions, not better versions

THE FIX:
PRODUCTION TIERS:

Tier 1: Quick (1-2 weeks)
- iPhone/simple shoot
- Stock + motion graphics
- Light editing
- Budget: $0-5K

Tier 2: Standard (4-6 weeks)
- Professional shoot (1 day)
- Simple concept
- Standard editing
- Budget: $5-20K

Tier 3: Premium (8-12 weeks)
- Full production
- Complex concept
- Multiple locations
- Budget: $20-100K

Tier 4: Epic (months)
- Only for major campaigns
- Clear business case
- Brand-defining moments
- Budget: $100K+

MATCH PRODUCTION TO NEED:
Social content: Tier 1
Product demo: Tier 2
Brand campaign: Tier 3
Once-a-year moment: Tier 4
```

---

## 3. The Trend Hijacking

**Severity:** High
**Situation:** Jumping on trends that don't fit the brand
**Why Dangerous:** Looks desperate, damages brand.

```
THE TRAP:
"TikTok dances are trending!"
Insurance company: Makes TikTok dance

"Memes are hot!"
Law firm: Posts memes

"Everyone's doing AI art!"
Luxury brand: Uses AI art

Audience: "This feels wrong"
Brand: "But it's trending!"

THE REALITY:
Not all trends fit all brands.
Trend participation must feel authentic.
Forced relevance = cringe.

TREND EVALUATION:
Before participating, ask:
1. Does this fit our brand voice?
2. Would our audience expect this from us?
3. Can we add unique value?
4. Will this age well?
5. Is it on-brand or just on-trend?

THE FIX:
Trend participation spectrum:

Ignore (most trends)
Reference (acknowledge, don't imitate)
Adapt (make it your own)
Lead (create the trend)

BRAND-APPROPRIATE RESPONSE:
Instead of: Following trend exactly
Try: Your unique take on the insight

Example:
Trend: Dancing brand mascots
Luxury brand: Don't do it
Snack brand: Do it perfectly
B2B company: Reference it cleverly
```

---

## 4. The Inside Joke

**Severity:** High
**Situation:** Creative that only makes sense internally
**Why Dangerous:** Audience has no context.

```
THE TRAP:
In the creative review:
"This reference to our founding story is so clever!"
"I love how we worked in the product codename!"
"The inside joke about our office is perfect!"

To the audience:
"I don't get it."
"What does this have to do with anything?"
"Who is this for?"

THE REALITY:
Your audience doesn't know:
- Your company history
- Your office culture
- Your product roadmap
- Your internal acronyms
- Your CEO's personality

THE FIX:
1. Test with outsiders
   Show to people who don't work there
   Watch for confusion

2. Explain in one sentence
   If you can't, it's too complex
   Or too inside

3. Assume zero context
   First impression = only impression
   No time for backstory

4. Value clarity over cleverness
   Clear wins over smart
   Memorable wins over clever

CREATIVE TEST:
Show to someone with no context.
"What do you think this is about?"
Wrong answer = back to drawing board.
```

---

## 5. The Forgettable Middle

**Severity:** High
**Situation:** Creative that's fine but not memorable
**Why Dangerous:** Wasted investment on invisible work.

```
THE TRAP:
Creative that's:
- Not bad enough to reject
- Not good enough to remember
- Safe
- "Fine"
- "Nice"
- Forgettable

THE REALITY:
Attention is competitive.
Average = invisible.
"Fine" = waste of money.

MEMORABILITY TEST:
Would someone:
- Talk about this to a friend?
- Remember it next week?
- Screenshot and share?
- Feel something?

If no to all = back to work.

THE FIX:
Push past "fine":

1. Embrace tension
   Safe = forgettable
   Some discomfort = attention

2. Find the unexpected
   What wouldn't they expect?
   What's the twist?

3. Emotional specificity
   Not "inspiring" → specific emotion
   Joy? Nostalgia? Surprise? Relief?

4. Kill the middle
   Either go big or keep it simple
   The middle is a wasteland

CREATIVE SPECTRUM:
Safe -------- Fine -------- Memorable
(invisible)  (forgettable)  (works)
```

---

## 6. The Execution-First Approach

**Severity:** Critical
**Situation:** Starting with tactics before strategy
**Why Dangerous:** Beautiful creative that achieves nothing.

```
THE TRAP:
"Let's make a video!"
"We need social content!"
"Can we do an experiential activation?"

Before asking:
- What's the objective?
- Who is the audience?
- What's the insight?
- What's the message?

THE REALITY:
Great creative solves a problem.
Without problem, no solution.
Tactics without strategy = waste.

THE FIX:
Start with brief:
1. Objective: What do we want to achieve?
2. Audience: Who specifically?
3. Insight: What do we know about them?
4. Message: What one thing to communicate?
5. Then: What format/channel?

CREATIVE BRIEF COMPONENTS:
Background: Context and situation
Objective: Measurable goal
Target: Specific audience
Insight: Audience truth
Message: One key takeaway
Mandatories: Non-negotiables
Deliverables: What we're making
Success: How we'll measure

STRATEGY → INSIGHT → IDEA → EXECUTION
Never skip to execution.
```

---

## 7. The Platform Ignorance

**Severity:** High
**Situation:** Creating content without understanding platform context
**Why Dangerous:** Great content in wrong format = wasted content.

```
THE TRAP:
Creating one piece of creative
Publishing everywhere unchanged

"Here's our brand video!"
TV: 60 seconds
YouTube: 60 seconds
Instagram: 60 seconds
TikTok: 60 seconds
LinkedIn: 60 seconds

Result: Works nowhere.

THE REALITY:
Each platform has:
- Different audience mindset
- Different format requirements
- Different content expectations
- Different success metrics

THE FIX:
Platform-specific creative:

TIKTOK:
- Vertical only
- Hook in first 0.5 seconds
- Native feel (not produced)
- 15-60 seconds
- Sound on, captions essential

INSTAGRAM REELS:
- Vertical
- Hook in 1 second
- Aesthetic matters
- 15-90 seconds

LINKEDIN:
- Can be horizontal
- Professional context
- Insight or education
- Can be longer

YOUTUBE:
- Horizontal
- Hook in 5 seconds
- Can be long-form
- SEO matters

PRINCIPLE:
Create for the platform, not just on it.
Adapt the idea, not just the format.
```

---

## 8. The Vanity Shoot

**Severity:** High
**Situation:** Expensive production that prioritizes aesthetics over effectiveness
**Why Dangerous:** Beautiful content that doesn't convert.

```
THE TRAP:
"This needs to be beautiful"
"Let's get a famous photographer"
"This should feel cinematic"

Budget: $200K
Result: Award-worthy visuals
Conversion: Zero

THE REALITY:
Beautiful ≠ effective
Awards ≠ results
Expensive ≠ better

THE FIX:
1. Start with objective
   What needs to happen after viewing?
   Optimize for that, not awards

2. Test ugly first
   Does the message work in simple format?
   Then add production value

3. Measure effectiveness
   Not just impressions
   Actual business outcomes

4. Production value hierarchy
   1. Message works
   2. Audience responds
   3. Brand-appropriate quality
   4. Then: Make it beautiful

PRODUCTION VALUE QUESTION:
"Will more production value increase effectiveness?"
Often the answer is no.
Sometimes ugly performs better.
```

---

## 9. The Overcrowded Message

**Severity:** High
**Situation:** Trying to communicate too many things at once
**Why Dangerous:** Nothing lands when everything's included.

```
THE TRAP:
Brief says:
- Communicate our new feature
- Reinforce brand values
- Mention the award we won
- Include customer testimonial
- Show product demo
- Drive to website
- Promote sale
- Establish thought leadership

In 30 seconds.

THE REALITY:
One message = remembered
Two messages = diluted
Three+ messages = nothing lands

THE FIX:
1. Single message ruthlessness
   What ONE thing must land?
   Everything else is bonus

2. Message hierarchy
   If they remember one thing...
   If they remember two things...
   Everything else: cut

3. Campaign thinking
   Different messages = different pieces
   Not everything in everything

4. Brief discipline
   Reject briefs with multiple objectives
   Push back until focused

MESSAGE TEST:
"After seeing this, they will think/feel/do:"
Fill in ONE thing.
If you have "and," cut something.
```

---

## 10. The Borrowed Interest

**Severity:** Medium
**Situation:** Using unrelated attention-grabbers to get noticed
**Why Dangerous:** Attention without connection = wasted attention.

```
THE TRAP:
"Let's use puppies in the ad!"
"Can we get a celebrity?"
"What if it's set during the Super Bowl?"
"Add a trending song!"

Product: Enterprise software
Connection to puppies: None

Result:
"Cute ad. What was it for again?"

THE REALITY:
Borrowed interest grabs attention.
Unconnected interest doesn't transfer.
Remembered entertainment ≠ remembered brand.

THE FIX:
1. Relevant attention
   Attention-grabber connects to product
   Or: Product IS the attention

2. Brand linkage
   Would this work for a competitor?
   If yes, it's not ownable

3. Earned entertainment
   The product story IS interesting
   Find the interesting angle

4. If borrowing, link it
   Celebrity who uses product
   Trend that relates to product
   Entertainment that demonstrates value

ATTENTION AUDIT:
What will they remember: The hook or the brand?
If just the hook, it's borrowed without linkage.
```

---

## 11. The Perfection Paralysis

**Severity:** High
**Situation:** Never shipping because it's never perfect
**Why Dangerous:** The best creative in the world is worthless if it never launches.

```
THE TRAP:
Review round 1: "Needs refinement"
Review round 2: "Getting there"
Review round 3: "Almost perfect"
Review round 4: "One more pass"
Review round 5: "So close"
...
Never launches.
Moment passes.
Money wasted.

THE REALITY:
Perfect is the enemy of good.
Timing matters.
Iteration beats perfection.

THE FIX:
1. Time-box creative
   Set deadline. Hit deadline.
   Creative is never done, only due.

2. Good enough threshold
   Define "good enough" upfront
   When reached, ship

3. Learn in market
   Ship → Learn → Iterate
   Better than theorize forever

4. Review limits
   Maximum review rounds defined
   Then it ships regardless

CREATIVE SHIPPING RULE:
80% quality shipped > 100% quality never
Your best guess now > perfect later
The market is the real test
```

---

## 12. The One-and-Done Campaign

**Severity:** High
**Situation:** Creating a single campaign asset instead of a system
**Why Dangerous:** Campaigns need multiple executions to land.

```
THE TRAP:
"We need a campaign!"
Creates: One hero video
Done!

THE REALITY:
Campaigns need:
- Multiple formats
- Multiple touchpoints
- Over time
- Consistent yet varied

One video is not a campaign.

THE FIX:
Campaign system thinking:

CAMPAIGN COMPONENTS:
Hero: Flagship creative (video)
Supporting: Extended/alternate versions
Social: Platform-native cuts
Static: Key frames as images
Refresh: Updates over time

MEDIA ACROSS TIME:
Launch: High frequency, hero content
Sustain: Lower frequency, supporting
Refresh: New executions, same campaign

CREATIVE SYSTEM:
Core idea → Multiple expressions
Each expression: Complete but connected
Variety within consistency

CAMPAIGN PLANNING:
Before creating hero:
- How many executions needed?
- What formats for each channel?
- How will it evolve over time?
- What's the refresh strategy?
```

## Decision Framework

| **Hybrid** | Best of both | Coordination complexity | Most mature creative orgs |

**Framework:**
```
In-house vs. agency decision:

Creative needs?
├── Day-to-day content → In-house
├── Major campaigns → Agency
├── Specialized skills → Agency
└── Volume production → In-house

Budget reality?
├── Fixed budget → In-house team
├── Campaign budget → Agency
├── Limited → In-house + freelance

WHAT TO KEEP IN-HOUSE:
- Brand stewardship
- Social content
- Quick-turn needs
- Ongoing production
- Template-based work

WHAT TO AGENCY:
- Campaign strategy
- High-production video
- Specialized skills
- Fresh perspective
- Big creative bets

HYBRID MODEL:
In-house: Core team, brand guardians

```

**Default Recommendation:** Build in-house for consistency and volume. Partner with agency for major campaigns and specialized skills.

---

## Decision 2: Production Investment Level

**Context:** Determining appropriate production value for creative work.

**Options:**

| Level | Budget Range | Timeline | Use When |
|-------|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Lo-fi** | $0-5K | Days | Testing, social, speed |
| **Mid-fi** | $5-25K | Weeks | Product content, social campaigns |
| **Hi-fi** | $25-100K | 6-8 weeks | Brand campaigns, key content |
| **Premium** | $100K+ | Months | Major campaigns, defining moments |

**Framework:**
```
Production investment criteria:

Business importance?
├── Testing/experimental → Lo-fi
├── Regular content → Mid-fi
├── Campaign content → Hi-fi
└── Brand-defining → Premium

Content lifespan?
├── Days (social, testing) → Lo-fi
├── Months (campaigns) → Mid/Hi-fi
├── Years (brand film) → Premium
└── Evergreen → Invest more

Audience reach?
├── Narrow/test → Lo-fi
├── Core audience → Mid-fi
├── Broad audience → Hi-fi
└── Mass market → Premium

PRODUCTION QUESTIONS:
1. What's the content lifespan?
2. How many people will see it?
3. What's the business impact?
4. Is this testing or scaling?

LO-FI OPPORTUNITIES:
- Social content
- Testing creative
- Fast response
- Authentic feel
- User-generated aesthetic

PREMIUM REQUIREMENTS:
- Major brand moment
- Long shelf life
- Broad reach
- Competitive position
- Differentiation need
```

**Default Recommendation:** Default to mid-fi. Go lo-fi for testing and social. Reserve hi-fi/premium for proven concepts at scale.

---

## Decision 3: Creative Testing Approach

**Context:** How to validate creative before scaling.

**Options:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|----------|------|------|-------------|
| **No testing** | Speed, conviction | Risk of failure | Low stakes, fast execution |
| **Quick test** | Fast feedback, iteration | Limited depth | Messaging, concepts |
| **Full research** | Comprehensive insight | Slow, expensive | Major campaigns, high stakes |
| **In-market test** | Real behavior | Requires spend | Performance creative |

**Framework:**
```
Testing approach selection:

Stakes level?
├── Low stakes → Ship without testing
├── Medium stakes → Quick test
├── High stakes → Full research
└── Performance → In-market test

Budget available?
├── None → Ship and learn
├── Some → Quick testing
├── More → Proper research
└── Significant → All of the above

QUICK TESTING:
- Concept boards to target audience
- 5-second test (first impressions)
- A/B social ads (small budget)
- Internal feedback (fresh eyes)

FULL RESEARCH:
- Focus groups
- Quantitative concept testing
- Brand lift studies
- Pre/post awareness

IN-MARKET TESTING:
- Small budget campaigns
- A/B testing at scale
- Performance metrics
- Real behavior data

TESTING WHAT:
Always test: Message comprehension
Sometimes test: Emotional resonance
Rarely test: Creative execution details
Never test: Innovation (too risky to test)

TESTING RISK:
Research can kill good ideas.
Balance testing with conviction.
Test to validate, not to decide.
```

**Default Recommendation:** Quick test for important concepts. In-market test for performance creative. Full research only for major campaigns.

---

## Decision 4: Brand Consistency vs. Creative Flexibility

**Context:** Balancing recognizable brand identity with creative exploration.

**Options:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|----------|------|------|-------------|
| **Rigid consistency** | Recognition, efficiency | Boring, limited | Early brand building, recognition priority |
| **Loose guidelines** | Creative freedom, freshness | Inconsistency risk | Strong brand equity |
| **Structured flexibility** | Balance of both | Complexity | Mature brands |

**Framework:**
```
Consistency vs. flexibility:

Brand maturity?
├── New brand → More consistency (build recognition)
├── Growing → Structured flexibility
├── Established → More flexibility (equity to spend)

Context?
├── Brand campaigns → Must be consistent
├── Product campaigns → Can flex more
├── Social content → Most flexibility
├── Experimental → Freedom to explore

BRAND ELEMENTS HIERARCHY:

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- Logo usage
- Core colors
- Legal requirements
- Brand voice principles

FLEXIBLE:
- Secondary colors
- Photography style
- Illustration approach
- Tone variations

EXPERIMENTAL:
- New visual territory
- Format exploration
- Collaborations
- Limited editions

FLEXIBILITY FRAMEWORK:
Brand campaign: 90% consistent
Product campaign: 70% consistent
Social content: 50% consistent
Experimental: 30% consistent (still recognizable)

BRAND RECOGNITION TEST:
Cover the logo. Is it still recognizably your brand?
If yes: Consistency working.
If no: Need more consistent elements.
```

**Default Recommendation:** Structured flexibility. Lock non-negotiable elements, allow experimentation within recognizable framework.

---

## Decision 5: Concept Development Process

**Context:** How to generate and develop creative concepts.

**Options:**

| Process | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|---------|------|------|-------------|
| **Solo creative** | Speed, vision | Limited perspectives | Small projects, clear brief |
| **Team brainstorm** | Diverse ideas, collaboration | Can be unfocused | Complex problems |
| **Pitch process** | Competition, options | Expensive, wasteful | Major campaigns |
| **Iterative** | Refinement, evolution | Slow | Unclear brief |

**Framework:**
```
Concept development approach:

Project scope?
├── Small/quick → Solo creative
├── Medium → Team brainstorm
├── Major → Pitch process
└── Exploratory → Iterative

Brief clarity?
├── Clear direction → Execute quickly
├── Strategic options → Explore concepts
├── Unclear → Research first
└── Open → Wide exploration

BRAINSTORM RULES:
1. Quantity over quality (at first)
2. No criticism during ideation
3. Build on ideas
4. Wild ideas welcome
5. Evaluate after, not during

CONCEPT EVALUATION:
Score against:
- Strategy delivery (does it deliver?)
- Distinctiveness (is it ownable?)
- Extendability (can it flex?)
- Feasibility (can we make it?)
- Memorability (will it stick?)

CONCEPT REFINEMENT:
Round 1: Wide exploration (10+ ideas)
Round 2: Narrow to 3-5 territories
Round 3: Develop 1-2 concepts
Round 4: Refine chosen direction
```

**Default Recommendation:** Team brainstorm for concept generation, then solo refinement. Pitch process only for major campaigns.

---

## Decision 6: Creative Approval Structure

**Context:** Defining who approves creative and how.

**Options:**

| Structure | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|-----------|------|------|-------------|
| **Single approver** | Speed, decisiveness | Risk of blind spots | Clear leadership |
| **Small committee** | Balanced perspectives | Slower | Medium stakes |
| **Stakeholder review** | Broad buy-in | Design by committee | High stakes, many owners |
| **Tiered** | Right rigor for stakes | Complexity | Mature organizations |

**Framework:**
```
Approval structure design:

Stakes and risk?
├── Low stakes → Single approver
├── Medium → Small committee
├── High → Structured review
└── Very high → Executive approval

APPROVAL TIERS:

Tier 1: Social content, minor updates
Approver: Creative lead
Timeline: 1-2 days

Tier 2: Campaign creative, product content
Approvers: Creative lead + marketing lead
Timeline: 3-5 days

Tier 3: Major campaigns, brand work
Approvers: Core team + exec
Timeline: 1-2 weeks

Tier 4: Major brand changes
Approvers: Full leadership
Timeline: 2-4 weeks

APPROVAL PRINCIPLES:
1. Fewer approvers = better creative
2. Clear criteria (strategy, not preference)
3. Time-boxed reviews
4. Single final decider
5. Trust the creative team

REVIEW QUESTIONS:
Not: "Do I like it?"
But: "Does it deliver the strategy?"

FEEDBACK RULES:
Specific over vague
Objective over subjective
Direction over prescription
```

**Default Recommendation:** Single approver for routine, small committee for campaigns. Always identify the final decider before starting.

---

## Decision 7: Video Length and Format

**Context:** Choosing appropriate video duration and format.

**Options:**

| Length | Best For | Platform | Attention Span |
|--------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **6-15s** | Awareness, social | TikTok, stories | Thumb-stop |
| **30s** | Standard advertising | TV, pre-roll | High attention |
| **60-90s** | Story, emotion | YouTube, streaming | Engaged |
| **2-5min** | Education, consideration | YouTube, website | Intentional |
| **5min+** | Deep content | YouTube, owned | Committed |

**Framework:**
```
Video length decision:

Objective?
├── Awareness → 6-15s
├── Engagement → 30-60s
├── Education → 2-5min
├── Entertainment → Varies
└── Conversion → 30s-2min

Platform?
├── TikTok/Stories → 15-60s
├── In-feed social → 15-30s
├── Pre-roll → 6s, 15s, 30s
├── YouTube → Any (2-5min sweet spot)
├── TV → 15s, 30s, 60s
└── Website → 30s-2min

Audience stage?
├── Cold audience → Shorter
├── Warm audience → Can be longer
├── Engaged/known → Longer acceptable

VIDEO STRUCTURE BY LENGTH:

6s:
[Hook] → [Brand]

15s:
[Hook] → [Point] → [Brand/CTA]

30s:
[Hook] → [Setup] → [Payoff] → [Brand/CTA]

60s:
[Hook] → [Story setup] → [Conflict] →
[Resolution] → [Brand/CTA]

2min+:
Full story arc possible
Build tension and resolve
Value-first for longer content
```

**Default Recommendation:** Create at multiple lengths from same shoot. Lead with 30s as versatile default, create 6s/15s cutdowns.

---

## Decision 8: User-Generated vs. Professional Content

**Context:** Balancing professional production with authentic UGC.

**Options:**

| Type | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| **Professional only** | Quality control, brand consistency | Expensive, less authentic | Brand campaigns, high production |
| **UGC only** | Authentic, cost-effective | Quality variance, less control | Social, testimonials |
| **Mixed** | Best of both | Coordination | Mature content program |

**Framework:**
```
UGC vs. professional decision:

Platform context?
├── TikTok → UGC feels native
├── Instagram → Mix works
├── YouTube → Professional for long-form
├── TV/OOH → Professional required
└── Website → Professional primary

Content type?
├── Testimonials → UGC preferred
├── Tutorials → UGC or mix
├── Brand → Professional
├── Social → UGC or lo-fi
└── Advertising → Depends on channel

UGC OPPORTUNITIES:
- Customer testimonials
- Product demos
- Social content
- Reviews and reactions
- Community content

PROFESSIONAL REQUIRED:
- Brand campaigns
- Product photography
- Broadcast advertising
- Brand films
- Major launches

UGC MANAGEMENT:
Source: Customers, creators, community
Rights: Clear usage agreements
Quality: Curation and selection
Amplification: Paid and organic
Incentives: Products, features, payment

MIXED APPROACH:
Professional: Hero and brand content
UGC: Supporting and social
Integration: Professional structure + UGC moments
```

**Default Recommendation:** Professional for brand content, UGC for social and testimonials. Integrate UGC into professional frameworks for authenticity.

---

## Decision 9: Campaign Duration and Timing

**Context:** How long to run campaigns and when to launch.

**Options:**

| Duration | Best For | Budget Efficiency | Impact |
|----------|----------|------------------|--------|
| **Burst (1-2 weeks)** | Launches, events | Lower efficiency | High spike |
| **Flight (4-8 weeks)** | Campaigns | Moderate | Sustained |
| **Always-on** | Brand building | Highest efficiency | Compound |
| **Pulsing** | Mix of above | Balanced | Peaks + base |

**Framework:**
```
Campaign duration decision:

Objective?
├── Launch/event → Burst
├── Campaign → Flight
├── Brand building → Always-on
├── Seasonal → Pulsing

Budget?
├── Limited → Burst (concentrate)
├── Moderate → Flight or pulse
├── Significant → Always-on + campaigns

TIMING CONSIDERATIONS:

Launch timing:
- Avoid major holidays (noise)
- Consider news cycles
- Competitor activity
- Audience availability
- Day of week (B2B: Tues-Thurs)

Seasonal timing:
- Category peaks
- Budget cycles
- Audience behavior
- Creative relevance

CAMPAIGN RHYTHM:

Burst: High frequency → Stop
[████████] → [ ]

Flight: Moderate frequency → Pause → Repeat
[████] → [ ] → [████]

Always-on: Consistent presence
[██] → [██] → [██] → [██]

Pulsing: Base + peaks
[██████] → [██] → [████] → [██]

OPTIMAL: Always-on base + campaign pulses
Maintains presence + drives peaks
```

**Default Recommendation:** Always-on foundational presence with campaign pulses for major moments. Avoid pure burst unless event-specific.

---

## Decision 10: Creative Refresh Frequency

**Context:** How often to update creative and when to retire.

**Options:**

| Frequency | Channel | Reason | Creative Investment |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------------------|
| **Weekly** | Social | Feed algorithm, freshness | Lo-fi, volume |
| **Monthly** | Paid social | Ad fatigue | Mid-fi, rotating |
| **Quarterly** | Display, video | Seasonal, optimization | Hi-fi, refresh |
| **Annually** | Brand campaigns | Major update | Premium, significant |

**Framework:**
```
Creative refresh decision:

Performance signals?
├── CTR declining → Time to refresh
├── CPM rising → Ad fatigue
├── Engagement dropping → New creative
├── Still performing → Keep running

Channel demands?
├── Paid social → Monthly refresh minimum
├── Display → Quarterly rotation
├── Video → Can run longer
├── Brand → When message changes

REFRESH VS NEW:

Refresh: Update existing
- New visuals, same message
- Seasonal adjustments
- Format variations

New: Different creative
- New campaign concept
- Major message shift
- Performance-driven change

AD FATIGUE INDICATORS:
- CTR decline
- Frequency > 3-4
- CPM increase
- Negative comments
- Performance plateau

CREATIVE TESTING CADENCE:
Social: Test new weekly, kill losers fast
Paid: Rotate monthly, test variations
Brand: Longer commitment, seasonal refresh

WINNING CREATIVE:
Don't refresh winners prematurely
Scale what works
Add variations vs. replace
```

**Default Recommendation:** Refresh paid social monthly, display quarterly. Let winners run until fatigue shows. Test constantly, kill quickly.

## Collaboration

### When to Hand Off

| Trigger | Delegate To | Context |
|---------|-------------|--------|
