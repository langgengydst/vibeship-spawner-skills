# Idea Maze Navigation

> Most startup ideas are bad. Not because founders lack creativity, but because
they're solving invented problems instead of lived ones.

Paul Graham's essays reveal a pattern: the best ideas come from living in the
future and noticing what's missing. Schlep blindness hides gold. Organic ideas
beat brainstormed ones. Frighteningly ambitious ideas are often easier.

This skill synthesizes PG's idea-finding wisdom into actionable guidance.

## Patterns

### Live in the Future Pattern
Position yourself at the bleeding edge of technology or culture and notice what's missing
**When:** Looking for startup ideas with lasting potential

### Schlep Mining
Look for opportunities everyone avoids because they seem tedious or hard
**When:** Finding ideas with built-in moats

### Problem Stacking
Find the same problem appearing repeatedly in your life or work
**When:** Validating that a problem is real and recurring

### Adjacent Possible Exploration
Look at what just became technically feasible and explore applications
**When:** Technology shifts create new solution spaces

### Organic Idea Harvesting
Notice ideas that emerge naturally from your work rather than forced brainstorming
**When:** Building sustainable motivation for multi-year commitment

### Tarpit Avoidance
Identify structural difficulties in certain idea categories and avoid them
**When:** Evaluating ideas that look good superficially


## Anti-Patterns

### Solution looking for a problem
Technology-first thinking, then hunting for use cases
**Why it's bad:** You'll never understand the problem as well as someone living it.

### Market research as oracle
Relying on reports and surveys instead of lived experience
**Why it's bad:** Market research tells you the past, not the future you want to create.

### Tarpit ideas
Ideas that look good but have structural problems
**Why it's bad:** These attract many founders but rarely work. Network effects are brutal
to bootstrap. Two-sided marketplaces have chicken-egg problems.


### The sitcom startup
Ideas that sound good in a TV pitch but aren't real problems
**Why it's bad:** If you have to explain it as "X for Y," it might be a forced analogy.

### Scratching a different itch
Building for users you don't understand
**Why it's bad:** You'll miss nuance, build wrong, iterate slowly.


## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

*Real production issues that cause outages and bugs.*

### [CRITICAL] Starting with a solution instead of a problem

**Situation:** "I want to build an AI chatbot" or "Let's use blockchain for something."
Technology looking for a problem. Months spent building something
nobody actually needs.


**Why it happens:**
Solutions without problems are hobbies, not businesses. You'll never
understand users as well as someone living the problem. The tech
will drive decisions instead of user needs.


**Solution:**
```
# Flip your thinking:

## Instead of:
"I want to build X technology"

## Ask:
"What problem do I face repeatedly?"
"What do I wish existed?"
"What would I pay for right now?"

## Validation:
- Do others have this problem?
- How are they solving it today?
- Why is today's solution inadequate?

## The PG test:
"Live in the future, then build what's missing"
Not: "Learn tech, then find application"

```

**Symptoms:**
- Starting with technology choice
- Searching for use cases
- Building without talking to users
- No personal pain with the problem

---

### [CRITICAL] Solving a problem you invented, not discovered

**Situation:** "I think people would want..." Based on theory, not observation.
No evidence anyone actually has this problem. Building on assumptions.


**Why it happens:**
Invented problems feel real to inventors. But users don't have them.
You can build a perfect solution to an imaginary problem. It will
still fail.


**Solution:**
```
# Evidence requirements:

## Before building anything:
- Talked to 20+ potential users
- Found the problem exists (unprompted)
- Saw them struggle with it
- Understood how they currently cope

## Red flags (you invented the problem):
- Users say "I guess that could be useful"
- No one currently paying for alternatives
- You have to explain why it's a problem
- Problem only exists in specific framing

## Green flags (problem is real):
- Users complain about it unprompted
- Money being spent on bad solutions
- Strong emotional reaction when discussed
- Users ask when you'll be ready

```

**Symptoms:**
- No user interviews before building
- Users need education about the problem
- Zero current spending on alternatives
- Lukewarm user reactions

---

### [HIGH] Pursuing ideas that look good but have structural problems

**Situation:** "It's a social network for X" or "A marketplace connecting Y to Z."
Ideas that sound good in conversation but have fundamental challenges
that make success nearly impossible.


**Why it happens:**
Tarpits attract many founders because they sound exciting. But they
have chicken-egg problems, network effect requirements, or capital
intensity that makes them near-impossible for most teams.


**Solution:**
```
# Common tarpits:

## Social networks:
- Need viral growth (very rare)
- Winner-take-all dynamics
- Competing with infinite-budget incumbents

## Two-sided marketplaces:
- Need both sides simultaneously
- Chicken-egg problem is brutal
- Leakage once connected

## Hardware:
- Needs millions in capital
- Long development cycles
- Manufacturing complexity

# If you must pursue:
- What is your wedge into the market?
- What is your unfair advantage?
- How do you bootstrap without network?

```

**Symptoms:**
- Describing idea as "X for Y"
- No clear wedge strategy
- Relying on viral growth
- No explanation for why incumbents haven't won

---

### [HIGH] Rejecting ideas because they involve hard, boring work

**Situation:** Great idea. But execution would require calling businesses, dealing
with regulations, or building complex infrastructure. Rejected in
favor of "cleaner" idea. Clean idea fails because it's crowded.


**Why it happens:**
Schleps (boring, hard work) are moats. Everyone avoids them, which
is exactly why they're valuable. Stripe succeeded because payments
were a schlep. Airbnb because photographing listings was a schlep.


**Solution:**
```
# Reframe schleps as opportunity:

## The schlep advantage:
- Others avoid it (less competition)
- Creates real value (hard to copy)
- Builds domain expertise (compounds)

## Questions to ask:
- What would I avoid doing even if it paid well?
- What work do experts do that seems tedious?
- What process does everyone hate but accept?

## The anti-pattern to avoid:
Choosing "clean" ideas because they're easier
Easy = crowded = commoditized

## Embrace the grind:
"If I'm not willing to do the hard thing,
I don't deserve the outcome"

```

**Symptoms:**
- Rejecting ideas because "too hard"
- Looking for "clean" tech-only solutions
- Avoiding industries with complexity
- Seeking ideas that scale immediately

---

### [HIGH] Pursuing ideas that are safe but small

**Situation:** "A slightly better to-do app" or "Improvement on existing product."
Safe ideas that don't scare you. Also don't attract talent, investors,
or press. Max outcome is acqui-hire.


**Why it happens:**
Frighteningly ambitious ideas are paradoxically often easier. They
attract better people, more capital, more press. Small ideas have
small outcomes even when successful.


**Solution:**
```
# The ambitious idea test:

## PG's examples of frighteningly ambitious:
- Replace email (Slack)
- Replace money (Stripe)
- Make all information accessible (Google)

## Signs you're thinking too small:
- Easy to explain to parents
- No one says "that's crazy"
- Many similar competitors exist
- Max outcome is a few million

## Think bigger:
- What's the 100x version of this idea?
- What would be worth 10 years of your life?
- What would attract a world-class team?

## Caution:
Ambitious doesn't mean impractical
Start with a wedge, grow to the vision

```

**Symptoms:**
- Ideas that feel "safe"
- No moonshot element
- Easy to explain in one sentence
- Incremental improvement on existing

---

### [HIGH] Generating ideas through brainstorming instead of observation

**Situation:** Team brainstorming session. 50 ideas on whiteboard. Vote on best one.
Build it. Fail. Because none of the ideas came from lived experience.


**Why it happens:**
Brainstormed ideas are manufactured, not organic. They lack the deep
understanding that comes from living the problem. Best ideas come
from noticing what's missing in your own life.


**Solution:**
```
# Organic idea generation:

## Better than brainstorming:
- Live in the future (use cutting-edge stuff)
- Notice friction (what's annoying?)
- Write down problems (idea journal)
- Talk to people (what frustrates them?)

## The signal:
Organic ideas feel obvious in hindsight
"Of course this should exist"
Not "wouldn't it be cool if..."

## If you must brainstorm:
- Start with problems, not solutions
- Only include people who have the problems
- Validate with outsiders immediately

## PG's advice:
If you have to ask "what should I build?"
You don't know enough yet. Go get more experience.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Ideas from brainstorm sessions
- No founder has the problem personally
- Choosing by vote not conviction
- Ideas feel theoretical

---

### [MEDIUM] Relying on reports instead of direct observation

**Situation:** "Gartner says this is a $50B market." Build based on report.
Report reflects the past, not the future. Market exists but you
have no edge. Fail to differentiate.


**Why it happens:**
Market research is backward-looking. It tells you where value
already exists, not where it's emerging. Everyone reads the same
reports. No competitive insight.


**Solution:**
```
# Better than reports:

## Direct observation:
- Talk to 30 potential customers
- Understand their workflow
- See their current solutions
- Feel their frustrations

## Forward-looking signals:
- What's changing in the world?
- What technology just became possible?
- What behavior is emerging?
- What do sophisticated users do?

## Market sizing from first principles:
- How many people have this problem?
- How much do they spend on alternatives?
- Why will they switch?
- What's your capture rate?

## The danger:
Reports create false confidence
"Someone validated the market"
No, someone described the past

```

**Symptoms:**
- Citing analyst reports
- No original user research
- TAM from third-party sources
- Market first, problem second

---

### [MEDIUM] Entering markets with obvious opportunities and many players

**Situation:** "The to-do app market is huge!" Yes, and there are 1000 to-do apps.
Obvious opportunities attract obvious competitors. Red ocean.


**Why it happens:**
If an opportunity is obvious, others see it too. You're competing
with everyone. The best opportunities look like bad ideas initially.


**Solution:**
```
# Find the non-obvious:

## Why good ideas look bad:
- Schlep (hard work scared others)
- Contrarian (consensus is wrong)
- Wedge (starts small, gets big)
- Expertise (you know something others don't)

## Questions:
- Why hasn't this been done?
- What do I know that others don't?
- What's changing that makes this possible now?
- Why would I win against everyone else?

## The test:
If your idea sounds good at a dinner party,
it's probably too crowded.

If people say "that won't work,"
you might be onto something.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Idea sounds obviously good
- Many existing competitors
- No clear differentiation
- Entering because market is big

---

### [MEDIUM] Building what users ask for instead of understanding their problems

**Situation:** "Users want X feature." Build it. Users don't use it. Because they
described a solution, not their underlying problem.


**Why it happens:**
Users are experts on their problems, not solutions. When they ask
for features, they're guessing at solutions. Understanding the
underlying problem reveals better solutions.


**Solution:**
```
# Dig deeper:

## When user requests a feature:
- "What are you trying to accomplish?"
- "Why is that important to you?"
- "What happens if you can't do this?"
- "How are you doing this today?"

## The 5 Whys:
Keep asking why until you hit the root

User: "I want to export to CSV"
Why? "To put in Excel"
Why? "To make a chart"
Why? "To show my manager"
Why? "To prove we should invest more"
→ Real need: reporting for stakeholders

## Build for the need, not the request

```

**Symptoms:**
- Roadmap is feature requests
- No problem understanding
- Features don't get used
- Users still unsatisfied

---

### [MEDIUM] Stopping validation too early with false positives

**Situation:** "5 people said they'd use it!" Built it. None of them use it.
They were being polite. Or theoretical. Or didn't understand
what they were agreeing to.


**Why it happens:**
People are polite. Hypotheticals are easy to agree with. True
validation is behavior, not words. Money, time, or effort.


**Solution:**
```
# Real validation signals:

## Strongest (action):
- They pay money upfront
- They sign a letter of intent
- They commit significant time
- They refer you to others unprompted

## Medium (effort):
- They join a waitlist with real info
- They schedule a follow-up call
- They introduce you to others

## Weak (words):
- "That sounds cool"
- "I'd probably use that"
- "Let me know when it's ready"

## The Mom Test rules:
- Talk about their life, not your idea
- Ask about the past, not hypotheticals
- Look for emotion, not politeness

```

**Symptoms:**
- Validation based on verbal interest
- No money or commitment
- Surveys instead of conversations
- Mom/friends as validators
