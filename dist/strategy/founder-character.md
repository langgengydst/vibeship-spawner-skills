and distilled patterns. Relentlessly resourceful. Fierce nerds. Earnest.
These traits matter more than credentials or connections.

This skill synthesizes PG's essays on founder character into actionable
guidance for developing the traits that predict success.

## Patterns

### Relentless Resourcefulness
When blocked, find a way around. Problems are puzzles, not walls.
**When:** Facing any obstacle or resource constraint

### Fierce Intellectual Curiosity
Combine genuine curiosity with competitive drive to understand deeply
**When:** Learning about problem space or making decisions

### Earnest Conviction
Genuine belief in what you're building without ironic distance
**When:** Communicating about your company or product

### Small Identity Maintenance
Keep ego separate from ideas to enable rapid learning
**When:** Receiving feedback or making decisions

### Reputation Compounding
Be difficult to work with limits who will join, invest, partner
**When:** All interactions with team, customers, investors, partners

### Direct Feedback Loop
Give and receive feedback directly, avoiding passive aggression
**When:** Addressing conflicts or performance issues


## Anti-Patterns

### Learned helplessness
Accepting blockers as permanent instead of solvable
**Why it's bad:** Resourceful founders find ways. This is giving up.

### Credential worship
Believing pedigree predicts success
**Why it's bad:** Credentials are past, not future. Many successful founders unconventional.

### Passive aggressiveness
Avoiding direct conflict while undermining
**Why it's bad:** Trust erodes. Problems fester. Real issues unaddressed.

### Idea protectionism
Treating your ideas as needing defense
**Why it's bad:** Best ideas emerge from rigorous debate. Defense prevents improvement.

### Performative passion
Faking enthusiasm you do not feel
**Why it's bad:** People detect inauthenticity. Unsustainable over years.

### Learned Helplessness
Accepting blockers as permanent instead of solvable puzzles
**Instead:** Reframe as puzzle. What's one way around this? What's another? Keep going.

### Credential Worship
Believing pedigree predicts success over character and capability
**Instead:** Evaluate by resourcefulness, curiosity, and character. Not resume.

### Passive Aggression
Avoiding direct conflict while undermining indirectly
**Instead:** Direct feedback delivered kindly. Disagreement is healthy. Hiding it is toxic.

### Idea Protectionism
Defending ideas against criticism instead of improving them
**Instead:** Separate ideas from identity. Seek strongest counter-arguments. Improve.

### Cynical Detachment
Maintaining ironic distance to protect against caring
**Instead:** Work on things you genuinely care about. Be earnest. Vulnerability is strength.

### Jerk Behavior Tolerance
Accepting mean behavior because someone is talented
**Instead:** No brilliant jerks. Talent plus kindness only. Non-negotiable.


## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

*Real production issues that cause outages and bugs.*

### [CRITICAL] Accepting blockers as permanent instead of solvable

**Situation:** We cannot do X because of Y. Full stop. No exploration of workarounds.
No creative problem solving. Just acceptance that the obstacle is
permanent.


**Why it happens:**
Resourceful founders find ways around obstacles. Helplessness is the
opposite of resourcefulness. Every blocker is a puzzle. Treating it
as a wall is failure mode.


**Solution:**
```
Reframe every blocker:

Instead of: We cannot do this because...
Ask: What is one way around this?
Then: What is another way?
Then: What would we do if this HAD to be solved?

Constraints inspire creativity. Walls inspire giving up.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Blocker accepted without exploration
- No workaround attempts
- Waiting for obstacle to resolve itself
- Giving up at first difficulty

---

### [HIGH] Believing success requires specific background or pedigree

**Situation:** We need someone from Google to solve this. I cannot pitch to investors
because I did not go to Stanford. Credentials as prerequisite for
action.


**Why it happens:**
Many successful founders are unconventional. Credentials predict past,
not future. Capability and character matter more than pedigree.
Credential worship is an excuse for inaction.


**Solution:**
```
Capability over credentials:

Instead of: Who has the right background?
Ask: Who can actually do this?

Instead of: I need X credentials to Y
Ask: What do I actually need to learn or demonstrate?

Prove capability through action, not resume.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Hiring for pedigree not skill
- Self-limiting due to background
- Credential requirements for action
- Intimidation by credentials

---

### [HIGH] Avoiding hard conversations to keep peace

**Situation:** Cofounder not pulling weight. Team member underperforming. Investor
overstepping. But we do not want to cause conflict. So nothing is
said. Problems fester.


**Why it happens:**
Hard conversations are part of the job. Avoiding them does not make
problems go away. It makes them worse. Founders must be direct,
even when uncomfortable.


**Solution:**
```
Direct feedback practice:

1. Name the issue specifically
2. Share impact
3. Listen to their perspective
4. Agree on next steps
5. Follow up

Conflict avoidance is not kindness. It is cowardice that hurts everyone.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Known issues not addressed
- Walking on eggshells
- Problems festering
- Venting to others instead of addressing directly

---

### [HIGH] Defending ideas as if they are personal identity

**Situation:** Team member challenges the approach. Founder gets defensive. Argument
becomes personal. Best ideas never surface because disagreement is
threatening.


**Why it happens:**
Ideas are not you. Defending ideas like identity prevents learning.
The best ideas emerge from rigorous debate. If you cannot be wrong,
you cannot improve.


**Solution:**
```
Separate ideas from identity:

When challenged, ask: Is this true?
Not: Are they attacking me?

Practice saying: I might be wrong. What do you think?

Seek the strongest counter-argument. Better to be wrong now than
fail later.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Defensive when challenged
- Ideas treated as personal
- Debate feels threatening
- Dismissing criticism

---

### [MEDIUM] Faking enthusiasm instead of genuine belief

**Situation:** Pitch is polished. Energy is high. But something feels off. Founder
does not actually believe. Just performing for investors. Unsustainable
over years.


**Why it happens:**
People detect inauthenticity. Manufactured passion does not last years.
Earnest belief attracts earnest people. Work on something you genuinely
care about.


**Solution:**
```
Authenticity check:

Do I actually care about this problem?
Would I work on this even if it was not fundable?
Am I excited to talk about this on my worst day?

If no, consider whether this is the right thing to build.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Rehearsed enthusiasm
- Dreading pitch conversations
- Different in private vs public
- Exhausted by pretending

---

### [MEDIUM] Ironic distance from work instead of earnest engagement

**Situation:** Everything is a bit of a joke. Do not care too much. Ironic distance
from the work. Cynicism as self-protection from failure.


**Why it happens:**
Building great things requires caring deeply. Cynicism is defense
mechanism. It protects from disappointment but prevents greatness.
Earnestness attracts earnest people.


**Solution:**
```
Embrace earnestness:

Care openly. Risk disappointment.
Genuine enthusiasm is attractive.
Cynicism repels good people.

If you cannot be earnest about this, find something you can be
earnest about.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Ironic tone about work
- Hedging enthusiasm
- Cynical about startup culture
- Afraid to care visibly

---

### [HIGH] Justifying difficult behavior as necessary for success

**Situation:** Founder is harsh with team. Justification: Great founders are tough.
Actually, best people avoid working with them. Reputation spreads.
Options narrow.


**Why it happens:**
Mean people fail in the long run. Reputation compounds. The best
talent, investors, and partners avoid difficult people. Kindness
is a competitive advantage.


**Solution:**
```
Tough but kind:

High standards: Yes
Direct feedback: Yes
Demanding excellence: Yes

Demeaning: No
Personal attacks: No
Making people feel small: No

Best people want to work with demanding but respectful leaders.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Harsh treatment justified
- Team turnover
- Reputation concerns
- Best candidates declining

---

### [MEDIUM] Comparing yourself to others instead of focusing on your path

**Situation:** Competitor raised more. Other founder is more successful. Feeling
inadequate. Comparison spiral instead of building.


**Why it happens:**
Every journey is different. Comparing yourself to others in different
circumstances is meaningless. Focus on your progress, not others
appearance of success.


**Solution:**
```
Focus on your path:

Only compare to yesterday you
Are you learning? Growing? Shipping?

Other people visible success is misleading
You see their highlights, not their struggles

Competition is noise. Building is signal.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Constant comparison
- Feeling inadequate
- Demotivated by others success
- Distracted from building

---

### [MEDIUM] Feeling like an impostor despite real capability

**Situation:** Founder actually capable. But feels like fraud. Does not speak up
in meetings. Does not pitch confidently. Self-doubt limits
effectiveness.


**Why it happens:**
Impostor syndrome is common but limiting. You do not need to know
everything. You need to learn fast and ship. Confidence comes from
action, not permission.


**Solution:**
```
Evidence-based confidence:

What have you actually accomplished?
What problems have you actually solved?
What do you actually know that others do not?

Build confidence from evidence, not feelings. Act, then believe.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Feeling like fraud
- Not speaking up
- Waiting for permission
- Self-doubt limiting action

---

### [MEDIUM] Attributing success to luck, failure to self

**Situation:** Things go well: We got lucky. Things go poorly: I am not good enough.
Asymmetric attribution that undermines confidence and learning.


**Why it happens:**
Success requires both skill and luck. Attributing all success to luck
prevents learning from wins. Attributing all failure to self prevents
learning from circumstances.


**Solution:**
```
Balanced attribution:

For success: What did we do right AND what was lucky?
For failure: What was in our control AND what was not?

Learn from both. Do not dismiss your role in success or your
environment in failure.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Dismissing wins as luck
- Blaming self for everything
- Not learning from success
- Over-attributing to self in failure
