# Early Stage Hustle

> Before product-market fit, your job is to learn as fast as possible.
That means doing things that won't scale - manual onboarding, concierge
service, recruiting users one by one.

Paul Graham's "Do Things That Don't Scale" is the bible here. This skill
synthesizes the hustle playbook that creates escape velocity.

## Patterns

### Collison Installation
Physically help users start using your product on the spot
**When:** Acquiring first users and learning onboarding friction

### Concierge MVP
Deliver the outcome manually before building automation
**When:** Testing demand before building complex systems

### Insane Responsiveness
Reply to every user message within minutes, not hours or days
**When:** Building early user loyalty and learning velocity

### Founder-Led Sales
Founders personally close every early deal, don't delegate
**When:** Learning what message resonates and building product intuition

### Small Batch Shipping
Ship tiny improvements daily based on what you learned yesterday
**When:** Pre-PMF when learning velocity matters most

### Desperation-Driven Quality
Make early users so successful they have to tell others
**When:** Building word-of-mouth before having marketing budget


## Anti-Patterns

### Premature automation
Building systems before understanding the problem
**Why it's bad:** You'll automate the wrong thing. Manual work reveals what actually
needs to be done. Automation locks in assumptions.


### Launch perfectionism
Waiting until it's "ready" to ship
**Why it's bad:** You're not learning. The market moves. You'll build wrong.
Every day not shipped is a day not learning.


### Spray and pray growth
Trying to reach everyone instead of finding true fans
**Why it's bad:** Vanity metrics without retention. You need 100 users who love you,
not 10,000 who bounce. Spray and pray teaches nothing.


### Hiring before fire
Building team before proving the product works
**Why it's bad:** Founders should do everything first. You need to understand every
function. Hiring multiplies what you've figured out.


### Building in stealth
Staying hidden because you're afraid of judgment or copying
**Why it's bad:** Ideas are worth nothing. Execution is everything. Stealth prevents
feedback and learning. No one will steal your idea.


### Premature Automation
Building systems before understanding the problem through manual work
**Instead:** Do it manually 50 times. Then automate what's clearly repetitive. Not before.

### Launch Perfectionism
Waiting until it's polished before showing users
**Instead:** Ship when core value works. Fix everything else based on real feedback.

### Spray and Pray Growth
Trying to reach everyone instead of making specific users successful
**Instead:** One channel. One user type. Deep success before broad reach.

### Hiring Before Doing
Hiring people to do work founders should do first
**Instead:** Do it yourself until drowning. Document what works. Then hire.

### Stealth Mode
Building in secret to avoid copying or criticism
**Instead:** Talk about it everywhere. Get feedback constantly. Ship publicly. Execute faster.

### Feature Scope Creep
Adding features before validating core value
**Instead:** Ship minimal core value. Add features only when users repeatedly request them.


## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

*Real production issues that cause outages and bugs.*

### [CRITICAL] Heads-down building without continuous user contact

**Situation:** "We'll get feedback after we launch." 3 months of building. Launch.
Nobody wants it. Could have learned this in week 1 with 5 conversations.


**Why it happens:**
Every day without user feedback is a day building blind. Users don't
know what they want until they see something. But you don't know
what to build until you talk to them. It's a loop, not a sequence.


**Solution:**
```
# The weekly user minimum:

## Non-negotiable:
- 10 user conversations per week
- Actual conversations, not surveys
- Watch them use the product if possible

## Schedule structure:
Monday: Schedule calls for the week
Tue-Thu: User conversations
Friday: Synthesize and ship

## What to ask:
- "What's the hardest part about [problem]?"
- "Tell me about the last time..."
- "How do you solve this today?"

## Never ask:
- "Would you use this feature?"
- "How much would you pay?"
(Hypotheticals lie)

```

**Symptoms:**
- Zero user calls this week
- Waiting until launch for feedback
- Building roadmap from assumptions
- Users are an afterthought

---

### [HIGH] Automating before understanding the problem manually

**Situation:** "We need to build the automated onboarding flow." Haven't onboarded
10 users manually yet. Automated the wrong thing. Users still confused.


**Why it happens:**
Manual work reveals what actually needs to happen. It shows edge cases,
user confusion, real needs. Automation locks in assumptions. Do it
50 times manually, then you'll know what to automate.


**Solution:**
```
# The manual-first rule:

## Do manually until:
- You've done it 50+ times
- You can predict every edge case
- You're drowning in volume
- Pattern is crystal clear

## What to do manually:
- Onboarding (call every new user)
- Support (you answer every ticket)
- Sales (founder-led)
- Success (personal check-ins)

## When to automate:
- You physically can't keep up
- The process is validated and stable
- Automation will match manual quality

```

**Symptoms:**
- Building automation before doing it manually
- Onboarding is a black box
- Don't know why users churn
- Engineering before validation

---

### [CRITICAL] Waiting for perfect before launching

**Situation:** "Just one more feature." "Need to fix this bug." "UI isn't polished."
6 months later, still haven't launched. Competitors shipped and learned.


**Why it happens:**
The market doesn't care about your feelings. Embarrassment is cheap,
learning is expensive. Every day not launched is learning you're not
getting. Ship now. Fix later.


**Solution:**
```
# The launch checklist (that's it):

## Required:
- Core value prop works (barely)
- Users can sign up
- You can contact users

## Not required:
- Perfect UI
- All features
- Scalability
- Edge cases
- Polish

## The rule:
If you're not embarrassed by v1, you launched too late.

## Accountability:
- Pick a date this week
- Tell someone (accountability)
- Ship it (no exceptions)

```

**Symptoms:**
- In development for 3+ months
- Always one more thing
- Afraid of negative feedback
- Waiting to be ready

---

### [HIGH] Optimizing for press/Product Hunt instead of real users

**Situation:** Product Hunt launch! #3 of the day! TechCrunch coverage! 10,000 signups!
Next week: 50 active users. 90% bounce. No retention. Back to zero.


**Why it happens:**
Launches give dopamine, not retention. The users who find you through
press are not your users. They're tourists. Real users come one at a
time through manual work.


**Solution:**
```
# Launch reality:

## Press is vanity:
- One-day spike
- Wrong users
- No retention signal
- Creates false confidence

## Real traction is:
- Users who came individually
- Manual onboarding
- Word of mouth
- Retention over weeks

## Better launch strategy:
- 100 users who love you > 10,000 who bounced
- One channel, go deep
- Handpick your first users
- Product Hunt can come later

## When press makes sense:
- Already have PMF
- Hiring/recruiting
- Competitive signaling
- Not for getting first users

```

**Symptoms:**
- Obsessing over launch platforms
- Measuring signups not retention
- Spike then flatline
- Big launch, small retention

---

### [HIGH] Hiring for tasks founders haven't done themselves

**Situation:** "We need a marketing person." Haven't done any marketing yourself.
Hired someone. They don't understand the product. Bad marketing.
Fired them. Blame the hire.


**Why it happens:**
Founders need to do every job first. You can't manage what you don't
understand. You can't evaluate what you haven't done. Do it yourself
until you're drowning, then you'll know who to hire.


**Solution:**
```
# Founder-first rule:

## Before hiring for any role:
- Do it yourself for months
- Understand what good looks like
- Know the edge cases
- Feel the pain

## Hire when:
- You're the bottleneck
- You know what to delegate
- You can evaluate output
- You can write the job description from experience

## What founders should do:
- First sales calls
- First customer support
- First marketing experiments
- First code (if technical)

```

**Symptoms:**
- Hiring before doing
- Can't evaluate the role
- Blaming hires for failure
- Delegating too early

---

### [HIGH] Trying many channels without going deep on any

**Situation:** "Let's try Facebook ads, content, SEO, partnerships, and PR."
Spread thin. Nothing works. "Marketing doesn't work for us."
Actually, you didn't try anything properly.


**Why it happens:**
Every channel requires focused effort to crack. Spreading across many
means learning none. One channel deeply understood beats five
channels touched superficially.


**Solution:**
```
# Single channel focus:

## Pick one channel:
- Where are your users already?
- What's your unfair advantage?
- What can you do uniquely well?

## Go deep:
- 80% of effort on that channel
- Learn everything about it
- Get to channel-market fit
- Only then expand

## Evaluate properly:
- Give each experiment enough time
- Measure leading indicators
- Iterate before abandoning
- Don't blame channel, fix execution

## Early stage channels:
- Manual outreach (always works)
- Community (where they hang out)
- Content (if you can write)

```

**Symptoms:**
- 5+ channels at once
- No channel working
- Constantly switching
- Blaming marketing

---

### [HIGH] Staying hidden because afraid of competition or judgment

**Situation:** "We can't tell anyone, they might copy us." "Let's stay in stealth
until we're ready." Months in hiding. No feedback. Building wrong.
When you launch, realize others solved it already.


**Why it happens:**
Ideas are worthless. Execution is everything. No one will steal your
idea - they're too busy with their own. Stealth prevents feedback
and learning. Talk about it constantly.


**Solution:**
```
# Anti-stealth mode:

## Talk about it everywhere:
- Tell everyone you meet
- Post on social media
- Write about the problem
- Get feedback constantly

## Why stealth hurts:
- No feedback loop
- No early users
- No word of mouth
- False confidence

## Competition reality:
- If idea is good, others will try
- Speed matters more than secrecy
- Your execution is the moat
- Ideas are multiplied by execution

## Only stealth when:
- Regulatory (rare)
- Deep tech with real IP (rare)
- Never for consumer/SaaS

```

**Symptoms:**
- Afraid to share
- NDA requests
- Secret building
- Paranoid about competition

---

### [HIGH] Building more features instead of finding more users

**Situation:** "If we had this feature, users would come." Built it. They didn't.
"Maybe one more feature." Endless feature additions. Zero growth.


**Why it happens:**
Features don't create distribution. Most products fail from obscurity,
not feature gaps. You need users finding you, not more to show them.


**Solution:**
```
# Distribution first:

## The balance:
- 50% time finding users
- 50% time building product
- Not 90% product, 10% users

## Distribution methods:
- Manual outreach (works for everyone)
- Content (compounds)
- Community (if you can find one)
- Paid (if unit economics work)

## When to build features:
- Users asking for something
- Retention is the problem
- Feature unlocks new segment

## When not to:
- "If we had X, users would come"
- Nobody knows you exist
- Building to avoid selling

```

**Symptoms:**
- Roadmap full, user count low
- Features as growth strategy
- Avoiding distribution work
- Building in comfort zone

---

### [HIGH] Not charging money because afraid of rejection

**Situation:** "We'll monetize later." "Let's get users first." "Free for now."
Year later, finally try to charge. Users leave. Never validated
willingness to pay. Business model doesn't work.


**Why it happens:**
Free users are not customers. Payment is the ultimate validation.
Charging from day one proves value and attracts serious users.
Revenue solves most problems.


**Solution:**
```
# Charge from day one:

## Why:
- Validates real value
- Attracts serious users
- Creates revenue runway
- Forces quality

## How:
- Start with any price
- Even $10/month proves something
- Increase until they push back
- Price is information

## Objection handling:
"Too early to charge" = Fear of rejection
"Need more features" = Fear of rejection
"Let's get users first" = Fear of rejection

## The test:
Would your users be very disappointed if it went away?
If yes, they should pay.

```

**Symptoms:**
- All free users
- Avoiding pricing conversations
- Planning to monetize later
- Free tier with no paid

---

### [CRITICAL] Building for scale before proving the idea works

**Situation:** "We need to be ready for millions of users." Spending months on
infrastructure. Zero users. Perfect system for nobody.


**Why it happens:**
Premature optimization is the root of all evil. Scale problems are
good problems. Most startups die from no users, not too many.
Build for 100 users, then 1000, then worry about scale.


**Solution:**
```
# Build for now, not later:

## Early stage priorities:
1. Does anyone want this?
2. Can we deliver value?
3. Will they pay?
4. Can we find more users?

## Not early priorities:
- Microservices
- Perfect architecture
- Infinite scale
- Technical perfection

## The rule:
Build for 100 users
If you get 100, rebuild for 1000
If you get 1000, then scale

## Warning signs:
- Discussing scale at <100 users
- Architecture for millions
- "We need to do it right"
- Over-engineering everything

```

**Symptoms:**
- Complex architecture, no users
- Scale discussions at seed stage
- Engineering perfectionism
- Afraid of tech debt
