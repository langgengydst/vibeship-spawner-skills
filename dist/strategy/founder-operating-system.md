# Founder Operating System

> Founders face unique challenges in how they work. Maker vs manager schedule
conflicts. Default alive vs dead math. Time and money slowly leaking away.
Effective founders develop systems for navigating these challenges.

This skill synthesizes PG's essays on founder productivity and decision-making
into an operating system for founder effectiveness.

## Patterns

### Maker Time Protection
Block long uninterrupted periods for deep work, batch meetings separately
**When:** Structuring daily schedule as a founder

### Default Alive Vigilance
Know your burn, growth, and path to profitability every month
**When:** Monthly strategic review

### Writing as Thinking
Write regularly to clarify thinking and communicate clearly
**When:** Making decisions and communicating with team

### Small Leaks Tracking
Watch how time and money slip away in small increments
**When:** Weekly operational review

### Strong Opinions, Loosely Held
Have conviction to move forward, update rapidly when evidence changes
**When:** Making decisions with incomplete information

### Batch Processing
Group similar tasks together to minimize context switching
**When:** Managing diverse founder responsibilities


## Anti-Patterns

### Calendar as tyrant
Letting calendar fragments destroy productive time
**Why it's bad:** Makers need blocks. Fragmented time is wasted time.

### Runway denial
Not knowing or facing default alive/dead status
**Why it's bad:** By the time you face it, options have narrowed.

### Thousand cuts
Death by small decisions, not big ones
**Why it's bad:** Each seems fine. Together they kill you.

### Verbal only culture
Never writing things down
**Why it's bad:** Thinking stays fuzzy. History is lost. Alignment unclear.

### Flip flopping
Changing direction with every new input
**Why it's bad:** Team whiplash. Nothing executes. Credibility lost.

### Calendar Tyranny
Letting meetings fragment maker time into useless chunks
**Instead:** Batch meetings. Protect mornings. Say no to scattered calendar.

### Runway Denial
Not knowing or facing default alive/dead status
**Instead:** Calculate monthly. Face truth. Take appropriate action early.

### Thousand Cuts Blindness
Ignoring small decisions that accumulate into failure
**Instead:** Track small decisions. Monthly review of scope/burn/time creep.

### Verbal-Only Culture
Never writing things down, all decisions in meetings
**Instead:** Write weekly updates. Document decisions. Think in writing.

### Flip-Flopping
Changing direction with every new input or conversation
**Instead:** Commit to positions. Update only with significant evidence.

### Always-On Burnout
Working constantly without recovery time
**Instead:** Protect evening/weekend recovery. Return fresh. Marathon requires pacing.


## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

*Real production issues that cause outages and bugs.*

### [CRITICAL] Meetings scattered throughout day destroying deep work

**Situation:** Six meetings spread across the day. Each one hour. But entire day is
gone. No deep work possible. Evening spent catching up on real work.
Burnout building.


**Why it happens:**
Makers need uninterrupted blocks. A single meeting can destroy an
entire morning of productive work. Context switching is expensive.
Calendar fragments, productivity crumbles.


**Solution:**
```
Calendar protection:

1. Block mornings for maker work - no exceptions
2. Batch all meetings in afternoon blocks
3. Meeting-free days if possible (2 per week)
4. Default to 25 or 50 minute meetings

Protect time like you protect money. It is more valuable.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Meetings scattered throughout day
- Never more than 2 hours uninterrupted
- Real work done evenings and weekends
- Constant context switching

### [CRITICAL] Not knowing or facing default alive vs dead status

**Situation:** Runway is 8 months. But have not calculated months to profitability.
Assume fundraising will happen. Actually default dead. By the time
realized, options have narrowed.


**Why it happens:**
Default alive vs dead determines what actions are appropriate. If
default dead, need urgent action: cut burn, accelerate revenue, or
raise now. Not knowing is dangerous.


**Solution:**
```
Monthly calculation:

Current burn: $X/month
Current revenue: $Y/month
Growth rate: Z%/month
Months to profitability at this trajectory: N
Runway remaining: M months

If M < N: DEFAULT DEAD - take action now
If M > N: DEFAULT ALIVE - can focus on growth

```

**Symptoms:**
- Do not know runway precisely
- Have not calculated path to profitability
- Vague hope about fundraising
- Surprised by cash crunch

---

### [HIGH] Gradual burn creep from small decisions

**Situation:** Burn was 50K. Now 120K. Cannot explain where it went. Each decision
was small. Better office. One more tool. Slightly higher salary.
Death by a thousand cuts.


**Why it happens:**
Big decisions get scrutiny. Small decisions slide through. Together
they kill. Every small increase is another month off runway.


**Solution:**
```
Weekly small decision review:

What got added this week?
What increased even slightly?
What could we remove without impact?

Zero-based thinking monthly:
If starting from zero, would we spend this?

```

**Symptoms:**
- Burn increased without clear reason
- Many small subscriptions
- Gradual lifestyle creep
- No review of small expenses

---

### [HIGH] Important decisions made verbally with no documentation

**Situation:** Strategy discussed in meeting. Everyone nods. Month later, different
recollections. No alignment. Same debates repeat. History lost.


**Why it happens:**
Writing forces clarity. Verbal decisions remain fuzzy. Documentation
creates alignment and history. Decisions that are not written down
are decisions that will be forgotten or reinterpreted.


**Solution:**
```
Write it down:

After important decisions:
- What did we decide?
- Why?
- What are the implications?

Shared document everyone can reference.
Prevents endless re-litigation.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Decisions only in meetings
- Different recollections later
- Same debates recurring
- No decision log

---

### [HIGH] Changing strategy with every new input

**Situation:** Investor says try X. Do X. Advisor says try Y. Do Y. Customer says Z.
Do Z. Team whiplash. Nothing executes. Nothing compounds.


**Why it happens:**
New input is constant. If every input changes direction, nothing gets
done. Strong opinions loosely held means having conviction while
remaining open to significant evidence. Not changing with every input.


**Solution:**
```
Input integration process:

When receiving new input:
1. Thank them for the input
2. Note it for consideration
3. Do NOT commit to change immediately
4. Evaluate against existing strategy
5. Only change if evidence is substantial

Commit to direction. Update only with significant reason.

```

**Symptoms:**
- New direction after every conversation
- Team confused on strategy
- Lack of commitment to direction
- Nothing executes long enough

---

### [MEDIUM] All execution, no thinking time

**Situation:** Every minute scheduled. Always doing. Never thinking. Strategic
decisions made on the fly. No time to process learnings. Busy but
not effective.


**Why it happens:**
Reflection is not luxury. It is essential. Processing what happened.
Planning what is next. Writing to clarify thinking. Without it,
you are reacting, not leading.


**Solution:**
```
Schedule thinking time:

Daily: 30 min morning planning, evening review
Weekly: 2 hours strategy thinking (no input, just thinking)
Monthly: Half day reflection on learnings

Protect this time like important meetings.

```

**Symptoms:**
- No unscheduled time
- Reactive decision making
- No time to think strategically
- Always in execution mode

---

### [MEDIUM] Defaulting to meetings instead of async communication

**Situation:** Every question becomes a meeting. Calendar is full. Simple things
take hours to resolve because everyone needs to be present.


**Why it happens:**
Most things do not need meetings. Async communication is often
faster and leaves documentation. Meetings should be for decisions
that need real-time discussion, not information sharing.


**Solution:**
```
Meeting decision tree:

Is this information sharing? Send an email.
Is this a simple question? Slack message.
Does this need real-time discussion? Maybe a meeting.
Does this need in-person energy? Yes, meeting.

Default to async. Meeting is the exception.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Meetings for everything
- Information shared in meetings only
- Calendar completely full
- Simple things require meetings

---

### [MEDIUM] Living in email inbox reacting to whatever arrives

**Situation:** Day starts with email. Ends with email. Respond to whatever is
loudest. No proactive work. Other people set the agenda through
what they send.


**Why it happens:**
Email is other people agenda. Living in inbox means doing what
others want, not what is important. Check email, do not live in it.


**Solution:**
```
Email batching:

Check email 2-3 times per day
Not first thing in morning
Process to empty, do not leave half-read
Between checks, work on priorities

Your agenda, not your inbox, should drive your day.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Email open all day
- Reactive to incoming
- No proactive priorities
- Other people setting agenda

---

### [MEDIUM] Doing everything yourself instead of building team capability

**Situation:** Founder does everything. No one else can do it right. Everything
runs through founder. Bottleneck forms. Cannot scale. Burnout.


**Why it happens:**
Early stage requires founders to do everything. But it must evolve.
Doing it yourself does not build team. Teaching others does.
Short-term slower, long-term faster.


**Solution:**
```
Delegation development:

1. Do it yourself first (learn it)
2. Document how you do it
3. Teach someone else
4. Let them do it (imperfectly at first)
5. Coach improvement
6. Step away

Build the team, not just the product.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Everything runs through founder
- Team cannot act independently
- Founder burnout building
- Bottleneck at founder

---

### [MEDIUM] Never writing to clarify and share thinking

**Situation:** Thinking stays in head. Never written. Ideas fuzzy. Team unclear
on strategy. Investors unsure what is happening. Communication gaps
everywhere.


**Why it happens:**
Writing is thinking. Unclear writing reveals unclear thinking. Regular
writing forces clarity, creates documentation, enables sharing.
Founders should write regularly.


**Solution:**
```
Regular writing practice:

Weekly: Investor update or internal memo
Monthly: Reflection on learnings
Quarterly: Strategic review

Publish when appropriate. Accountability helps.

```

**Symptoms:**
- Rarely write anything
- Thinking stays fuzzy
- Team unclear on strategy
- No documentation of thinking
