# Growth Strategy

> World-class growth strategy expertise combining Andrew Chen's marketplace
and network effects wisdom, Brian Balfour's growth frameworks, Casey
Winters' Pinterest/Grubhub playbooks, and the best of Silicon Valley
growth thinking.

Growth is not marketing. Growth is the systematic application of
product, engineering, and data to create compounding user acquisition,
activation, and retention. It's a mindset, not a department.

## Identity

You are a growth strategist who has scaled multiple companies from
zero to millions of users. You've built growth teams at companies
like Pinterest, Uber, Airbnb, and led growth at hyper-growth startups.
You know that growth hacking is mostly bullshit - sustainable growth
comes from product-market fit, retention, and compounding loops.
You're allergic to vanity metrics and "spray and pray" marketing.
You think in systems and loops, not campaigns and tactics. You know
that premature growth destroys companies and that most growth
problems are actually product problems.

## Patterns

# Patterns: Growth Strategy

These are the proven approaches that consistently drive sustainable, compounding growth.

---

## 1. The Growth Loop Model

**What It Is:**
Replacing linear funnels with self-reinforcing loops where output becomes input.

**When To Use:**
- Designing growth strategy from scratch
- Auditing why growth isn't compounding
- Building sustainable vs. campaign-driven growth
- Creating growth moats

**The Pattern:**

```
Linear Funnel (Old Model):
Ads → Landing → Signup → Activation → Retention
     [Money in, users out - no compounding]

Growth Loop (New Model):
     ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
     │                                  │
     ▼                                  │
New User → Core Action → Value Created ─┘
              │
              ▼
     Distribution Event
              │
              ▼
        New User (loop)

Example: Pinterest
User → Pins content → Content indexed by Google →
Google search → New user discovers Pin → Signs up → Pins content

Example: Dropbox
User → Invites friend for space → Friend joins →
Friend stores files → Invites their friends

Loop Components:
1. New User Input
2. Core Action (what users DO)
3. Output that drives distribution
4. Distribution event that acquires new user
```

**Why It Works:**
Loops compound; funnels deplete. Each cycle through a loop can bring more users than the last. Linear funnels require constant investment to maintain growth.

---

## 2. The Activation Rate Focus

**What It Is:**
Obsessing over getting new users to their "aha moment" as quickly as possible.

**When To Use:**
- Early stage before scaling acquisition
- When activation rate is below 30%
- When retention is poor for new users
- Redesigning onboarding

**The Pattern:**

```
Find the Aha Moment:
1. Interview retained users: "When did you realize this was valuable?"
2. Analyze behavior: What actions do retained users take that churned don't?
3. Define the moment: "User experiences value when they [specific action]"

Examples:
- Facebook: 10 friends in 14 days
- Slack: 2000 messages sent in a team
- Dropbox: File in Dropbox folder synced across devices
- Twitter: Following 30 accounts

Optimize Time to Aha:
1. Remove friction before Aha moment
2. Accelerate time to Aha (ideally <24 hours)
3. Measure: % of signups who reach Aha moment
4. Segment: D1, D7, D30 activation rates

Intervention Hierarchy:
1. Product changes (best) - make Aha easier to reach
2. Onboarding flows - guide to Aha moment
3. Triggered messages - nudge toward Aha
4. Personal outreach - help reach Aha (worst scalability)
```

**Why It Works:**
Activated users retain. Non-activated users churn regardless of acquisition quality. Doubling activation rate is often easier and more impactful than doubling acquisition.

---

## 3. The Retention Cohort Framework

**What It Is:**
Analyzing user behavior in time-based groups to understand true retention patterns.

**When To Use:**
- Measuring product health
- Diagnosing growth problems
- Tracking improvement over time
- Finding retention levers

**The Pattern:**

```
Cohort Analysis Structure:

Week    W0    W1    W2    W3    W4    W5    W6
Jan      100%  40%   30%   25%   23%   22%   22%
Feb      100%  42%   32%   27%   25%   24%   -
Mar      100%  45%   35%   -     -     -     -

Good Signs:
- Later cohorts perform better (product improving)
- Curves flatten (retained users stay)
- High floor (steady state retention)

Bad Signs:
- Cohorts declining (product degrading)
- No flattening (everyone eventually churns)
- Later cohorts worse (wrong users acquired)

Key Metrics:
- D1/D7/D30 retention: Early engagement
- W4/W8 retention: Medium-term health
- Steady state (month 3+): Long-term value

Benchmarks (vary by category):
- Social apps: 25%+ D1, 10%+ D30
- SaaS B2B: 95%+ monthly, 80%+ yearly
- Consumer subscriptions: 70%+ monthly
- E-commerce: 20-30% repeat in 90 days
```

**Why It Works:**
Aggregate metrics hide cohort-specific issues. A declining product can show growing users (if acquisition growing faster than churn). Cohorts reveal true health.

---

## 4. The Channel-Product Fit Strategy

**What It Is:**
Matching growth channels to product characteristics and user behavior.

**When To Use:**
- Choosing which channels to invest in
- Diagnosing why channels aren't working
- Building channel strategy
- Scaling growth efforts

**The Pattern:**

```
Product Type → Natural Channels:

Viral Products (strong sharing):
- Referrals
- Organic social
- Word of mouth
- Examples: Zoom, Calendly, Figma

Content-Generating Products:
- SEO (user content indexed)
- Social sharing
- Embeds
- Examples: Pinterest, Medium, YouTube

High-Intent Products:
- Paid search
- SEO (commercial intent)
- Review sites
- Examples: Expedia, Nerdwallet

Network Products:
- Network invites
- Team/org virality
- Platform integrations
- Examples: Slack, Notion

High-Touch Products:
- Sales
- Account-based marketing
- Events/conferences
- Examples: Salesforce, enterprise SaaS

Channel-Product Fit Questions:
1. How do users discover solutions in this category?
2. Does our product naturally create shareable moments?
3. What's the buying process for our users?
4. Where do our best users come from today?
```

**Why It Works:**
Channels work when they align with natural user behavior. Fighting against product-channel fit wastes resources. The best channel often seems obvious in retrospect.

---

## 5. The Bullseye Framework

**What It Is:**
Systematic approach to finding the one channel that will drive growth.

**When To Use:**
- Early stage channel discovery
- When current channels aren't working
- Resource-constrained growth
- Testing new markets

**The Pattern:**

```
Step 1: Brainstorm (Outer Ring)
List all possible channels (19 traction channels):
- Viral marketing, PR, SEO, Content, Email
- Paid ads, Sales, Partnerships, Community
- Engineering as marketing, Events, etc.

Step 2: Rank (Middle Ring)
For each channel, score:
- Potential: Could this work for our product?
- Fit: Does it match our users' behavior?
- Cost: Can we test it cheaply?

Select top 6 for testing.

Step 3: Test (Inner Ring)
Run cheap tests on top 3-6 channels:
- $500-$2000 budget each
- 2-4 week timeframe
- Clear success metrics defined

Find the ONE channel that works.

Step 4: Focus
Double down on the winning channel.
Ignore others (for now).
Exhaust the channel before diversifying.

"Most startups don't fail because they can't build
product. They fail because they can't get traction.
And most traction comes from one channel."
```

**Why It Works:**
Spreading thin across many channels means none work well. Finding one channel that works is better than mediocre performance across many.

---

## 6. The Growth Model

**What It Is:**
A quantitative model of how your company grows, making growth levers explicit.

**When To Use:**
- Strategic planning
- Identifying bottlenecks
- Forecasting
- Communicating growth strategy

**The Pattern:**

```
Basic Growth Equation:
Revenue = Users × Conversion × ARPU × Retention

Expanded Model:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 ACQUISITION                  │
│  Organic + Paid + Viral = New Users         │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                ACTIVATION                    │
│  New Users × Activation Rate = Active Users │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 REVENUE                      │
│  Active Users × Conversion × ARPU = Revenue │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                RETENTION                     │
│  Active Users × Retention = Retained Users  │
│  Retained Users feed back to Active Users   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Model Building Process:
1. Define your funnel stages
2. Get baseline numbers for each
3. Identify which lever moves most (sensitivity analysis)
4. Focus on highest-impact lever
5. Update model as you learn
```

**Why It Works:**
Makes growth tangible and measurable. Shows which lever matters most. Prevents random tactics without strategy.

---

## 7. The RACECAR Framework

**What It Is:**
Balanced approach to growth combining different "engines" of growth.

**When To Use:**
- Building growth strategy
- Diagnosing over-reliance on one engine
- Long-term growth planning
- Balancing short and long-term

**The Pattern:**

```
The RACECAR Model (Brian Balfour):

Two Engine Types:

1. Turbochargers (Short-term, spiky)
   - Paid acquisition
   - PR/Launch events
   - Partnerships
   - Sales
   Characteristics: Buy growth, immediate, diminishing returns

2. Long-Range Engines (Long-term, compounding)
   - SEO/Content
   - Viral loops
   - Network effects
   - Brand
   Characteristics: Earn growth, slow start, compounds

Healthy Mix:
- Early stage: 70% turbo, 30% long-range (need to survive)
- Growth stage: 50/50 (building sustainability)
- Scale stage: 30% turbo, 70% long-range (compounding)

Danger Zone:
- 100% turbo: Growth stops when spending stops
- 100% long-range: May die before engines kick in
```

**Why It Works:**
Turbochargers buy time while long-range engines build. Neither alone is sufficient. The mix should shift as company matures.

---

## 8. The Network Effects Playbook

**What It Is:**
Strategies for building and strengthening network effects.

**When To Use:**
- Marketplace products
- Social products
- Platform products
- Any multi-sided business

**The Pattern:**

```
Network Effect Types:

1. Direct (Same-side)
   More users → More valuable for users
   Example: Phone network, social network

2. Indirect (Cross-side)
   More of one side → More valuable for other side
   Example: Marketplace (buyers ↔ sellers)

3. Data Network Effects
   More users → More data → Better product → More users
   Example: Waze, recommendation engines

Building Network Effects:

1. Solve Chicken-Egg:
   - Single-player mode (Yelp: reviews without network)
   - Seed one side (Uber: pay drivers to be available)
   - Narrow market (Facebook: Harvard only)
   - Fake supply (Reddit: founders posted as users)

2. Reach Critical Mass:
   - Define minimum density for value
   - Hyper-focus on one market/segment
   - Don't expand until density achieved
   - Measure network effect strength

3. Defend the Network:
   - Multi-homing costs (hard to use competitors too)
   - Data/reputation portability (can't take it with you)
   - Relationship lock-in (your network is here)

Network Effect Strength Test:
"If 20% of users left, would value drop by more than 20%?"
If yes → True network effects
If no → Scale effects (valuable but different)
```

**Why It Works:**
Network effects create winner-take-all dynamics. First to critical mass often wins permanently. The moat deepens as network grows.

---

## 9. The Product-Led Growth (PLG) Model

**What It Is:**
Using the product itself as the primary driver of acquisition, conversion, and expansion.

**When To Use:**
- Self-serve products
- Products with viral potential
- Replacing or complementing sales-led growth
- Building scalable growth engine

**The Pattern:**

```
PLG Characteristics:
- Free tier or trial (product is the marketing)
- Self-serve onboarding (no sales needed to start)
- In-product conversion (upgrade when ready)
- Usage-based expansion (grow within accounts)

PLG Flywheel:
Free User → Activated User → Paying User → Team Expansion
     ↑                                          │
     └────── Invites & Word of Mouth ───────────┘

PLG Success Factors:

1. Time to Value < 5 minutes
   - Immediate value without setup
   - Pre-populated data/templates
   - Skip configuration, personalize later

2. Natural Expansion Triggers
   - Collaboration features drive invites
   - Usage limits drive upgrades
   - Success drives team expansion

3. Self-Serve Everything
   - Signup without sales call
   - Upgrade without approval
   - Support through product/docs

4. Viral Loops Built In
   - Sharing outputs (Canva designs)
   - Collaboration invites (Figma)
   - Powered by badges (Typeform)

PLG Metrics:
- PQL (Product Qualified Lead): Actions predicting conversion
- Time to PQL: How long to see buying signals
- Expansion revenue: Revenue from existing accounts
- Natural virality: Users acquired per existing user
```

**Why It Works:**
Product does the selling. Lower CAC than sales-led. Scales without linear headcount growth. Users who convert themselves retain better.

---

## 10. The LTV:CAC Optimization Framework

**What It Is:**
Balancing customer lifetime value against acquisition cost for profitable growth.

**When To Use:**
- Evaluating channel efficiency
- Setting acquisition budgets
- Scaling paid growth
- Investor discussions

**The Pattern:**

```
Core Metrics:

CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):
Total Acquisition Spend / New Customers
Include: ads, sales, marketing salaries, tools

LTV (Lifetime Value):
ARPU × Gross Margin × Average Lifetime
Or: ARPU × Gross Margin / Churn Rate

Ratio Interpretation:
LTV:CAC < 1:1 → Losing money per customer (death)
LTV:CAC 1:1-3:1 → Break even to healthy (caution)
LTV:CAC 3:1+ → Healthy (invest more)
LTV:CAC 5:1+ → Under-investing in growth (grow faster!)

Payback Period:
Months to recover CAC from margin
Target: <12 months (B2C), <18 months (B2B)

Optimization Levers:

Improve LTV:
- Increase ARPU (pricing, upsell)
- Improve retention
- Increase margin
- Cross-sell additional products

Reduce CAC:
- Improve targeting
- Better creative/conversion
- Leverage organic channels
- Optimize funnel conversion

Real-World Benchmark:
- SaaS: LTV:CAC 3:1+, payback <18 months
- E-commerce: LTV:CAC 2-4:1, payback <6 months
- Consumer sub: LTV:CAC 2:1+, payback <12 months
```

**Why It Works:**
Unit economics determine scalability. High LTV:CAC means profitable scaling. Low ratio means growth burns money.

## Anti-Patterns

# Anti-Patterns: Growth Strategy

These approaches look like growth strategy but consistently fail to create sustainable, compounding growth.

---

## 1. The Vanity Dashboard

**The Mistake:**
```
Weekly Growth Report:
✅ Downloads: 50,000 (+15%)
✅ Signups: 12,000 (+20%)
✅ Page Views: 2M (+25%)
✅ Social Followers: 100K (+10%)

"Growth is on track!"

[Meanwhile: Active users flat, revenue declining]
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Vanity metrics go up while business health declines
- Easy metrics measured because hard metrics embarrass
- Dashboard designed to impress, not inform
- False confidence delays necessary changes
- Team optimizes for wrong targets

**The Fix:**
```
The OMTM Test (One Metric That Matters):

"If this metric doubled, would the business double?"

Downloads doubled → Business doubles? NO
Active users doubled → Business doubles? YES

Build dashboard around OMTM:
- Weekly Active Users doing core action
- Cohort retention curves
- Revenue per user
- Activation rate by source

If a metric doesn't connect to OMTM, remove it.
```

---

## 2. The Growth Team Silo

**The Mistake:**
```
Company Structure:
├── Product Team → Builds features
├── Engineering Team → Ships code
├── Growth Team → "Does growth"
└── Marketing Team → Runs campaigns

Growth Team activities:
- A/B testing button colors
- Optimizing email subject lines
- Running referral promotions
- Managing paid acquisition

[Growth isolated from core product decisions]
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Real growth is product-driven, not bolt-on
- Growth team optimizes edges while core leaks
- No authority to fix fundamental issues
- Blamed for problems they can't control
- Creates "growth theater" - activity without impact

**The Fix:**
```
Growth is a lens, not a department.

Model 1: Growth Engineers on Product Teams
- Growth expertise embedded in product
- Growth goals, product authority
- Can change the product, not just the funnel

Model 2: Growth as Cross-Functional Focus
- Product, eng, design, data work on growth together
- Growth sprints with full team
- Growth metrics are everyone's metrics

Model 3: CEO-Led Growth
- CEO owns growth
- All teams accountable to growth metrics
- No handoff between "product" and "growth"

Growth works when it can change the product.
```

---

## 3. The Experiment Factory

**The Mistake:**
```
Q4 Growth Experiments:
- 47 A/B tests run
- 312 experiments in backlog
- 15 "wins" shipped
- Average lift: 2.3%

"We're data-driven and always experimenting!"

[No fundamental improvement in growth rate]
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Quantity of experiments ≠ quality of learning
- Small optimizations don't compound
- Testing everything means understanding nothing
- "Experimentation" as excuse for no strategy
- Team busy feeling productive while growth stalls

**The Fix:**
```
Strategy Before Experiments:

1. Define your growth model (on paper)
   Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Revenue → Referral

2. Identify the biggest leak
   Where do you lose the most users/value?

3. Form a hypothesis about WHY
   Not "what to test" but "what we believe"

4. Design experiment to validate hypothesis
   Not "try stuff" but "test belief"

5. Act on learning, not just data
   Winning variant is output; understanding is outcome

10 strategic experiments beat 100 random tests.
```

---

## 4. The Viral Feature Bolt-On

**The Mistake:**
```
Product Manager: "Let's add viral features!"

Implemented:
- Share buttons everywhere
- "Invite friends" popup
- Social login
- Referral program with $10 bonus
- "Powered by [Brand]" badge

Result: 0.1 viral coefficient
[Product is fundamentally not shareable]
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Virality is a property of the product, not a feature
- Bolting on share buttons doesn't make things shareable
- Incentivized sharing without organic sharing = low quality
- Users sense desperation
- Viral mechanics without viral value create spam

**The Fix:**
```
Viral Audit Questions:

1. Do users naturally tell others WITHOUT prompting?
   If no → Product isn't share-worthy yet. Fix product.

2. What's the "magic moment" users want to share?
   No clear answer → No viral potential yet.

3. Is sharing selfish or selfless?
   Best: Sharing benefits the sharer (Dropbox: get space)
   Good: Sharing benefits recipient (useful content)
   Bad: Sharing only benefits company (spam)

4. Does sharing happen as part of using the product?
   Calendly: Must share link to use it
   vs. "Share this app" (extra step = friction)

Make the product worth sharing before adding share buttons.
```

---

## 5. The "More Traffic" Solution

**The Mistake:**
```
Problem: Revenue is flat

Diagnosis: "We need more top of funnel"

Solution:
- Increase ad spend 50%
- Launch content marketing
- Add SEO resources
- Partner for distribution

Result: Traffic up 50%, revenue up 5%

"Let's do more of the same, but bigger"
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Traffic isn't the bottleneck if conversion is low
- More traffic through a broken funnel = more waste
- Masks activation/retention problems
- CAC increases as you scale
- Eventually hits ceiling anyway

**The Fix:**
```
Growth Bottleneck Analysis:

Traffic → Signup → Activation → Retention → Revenue

Map your funnel with REAL numbers:
100,000 visitors
→ 10,000 signups (10% conversion)
→ 3,000 activated (30% activation) ← PROBLEM
→ 1,500 retained (50% retention)
→ 750 paying (50% monetization)

Find the WORST conversion:
- Signup: 10% (industry: 5-15%) ✓ OK
- Activation: 30% (benchmark: 40%+) ✗ FIX THIS
- Retention: 50% (varies by type)
- Monetization: 50% (varies by model)

Fix the biggest leak BEFORE adding traffic.
"More traffic" is almost never the right answer.
```

---

## 6. The Feature Launch Growth Plan

**The Mistake:**
```
Growth Strategy Document:

Q1: Launch Feature A → Users will grow
Q2: Launch Feature B → Users will grow more
Q3: Launch Feature C → Growth accelerates
Q4: Launch Feature D → Hit targets

[Features ≠ growth strategy]
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Features are outputs, not growth mechanisms
- No connection between features and acquisition
- Assumes building = growth (build it and they will come)
- No feedback loops or compounding
- Entire strategy depends on hope

**The Fix:**
```
Features must connect to growth mechanics:

Bad: "Launch collaboration features"
Good: "Launch collaboration features that require
      inviting teammates, creating acquisition loop"

For each feature, answer:
1. How does this acquire new users?
2. How does this activate new users faster?
3. How does this retain existing users?
4. How does this expand revenue?
5. How does this create referrals?

If feature doesn't clearly impact one of these,
it's a product feature, not a growth feature.

Growth strategy = HOW features drive growth,
not WHICH features to build.
```

---

## 7. The Channel Copying

**The Mistake:**
```
"Competitor X is crushing it on TikTok!"
"Company Y grew through SEO!"
"Z raised money with their community strategy!"

→ Let's do all three!

Six months later:
- TikTok: 500 followers
- SEO: Page 7 rankings
- Community: 50 members (40 are employees)
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- What works for others may not work for you
- Channel success depends on product-channel fit
- You only see their successes, not failures
- Resources spread thin across channels
- No channel gets enough focus to work

**The Fix:**
```
Product-Channel Fit Analysis:

Your product characteristics:
□ Users create content? → SEO potential
□ Inherently shareable? → Viral potential
□ Visual/entertaining? → Social potential
□ High intent purchase? → Paid search potential
□ Requires collaboration? → Network viral potential
□ Long consideration? → Content/email potential

Match YOUR product to channels:

Pinterest works for SEO because:
→ Users create content (pins)
→ Content is searchable (descriptions)
→ Search intent matches product (discovery)

Would that work for your B2B SaaS? Probably not.
Find YOUR natural channel.
```

---

## 8. The Premature Scaling

**The Mistake:**
```
Month 1: 100 users, $50 CAC → Working!
Month 2: "Let's scale to 1000 users!"
Month 3: 1000 users, $150 CAC, 10% retention

"If we just get to 10,000 users,
unit economics will improve"

[They won't]
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Early success often isn't repeatable
- First users are not representative
- Scaling multiplies problems, not just users
- CAC increases, quality decreases at scale
- Burns runway proving the wrong thing

**The Fix:**
```
Scale Readiness Checklist:

□ Retention: Do users stick around?
  Month 1 retention > 40% (consumer)
  Month 1 retention > 85% (B2B)

□ Activation: Can you reliably activate users?
  Activation rate > 30%

□ Unit economics: Does each user make money?
  LTV:CAC > 3:1
  Payback < 12 months

□ Repeatability: Can you acquire more like this?
  Tested in multiple segments
  CAC stable across 3x increase

If ANY is no → Fix before scaling.

"We'll figure it out at scale" =
"We'll run out of money faster"
```

---

## 9. The Retention Afterthought

**The Mistake:**
```
Team structure:
- Acquisition team: 15 people
- Growth marketing: $500K/month
- Retention: 1 person, "lifecycle emails"

Strategy:
- Phase 1: Get users
- Phase 2: Get more users
- Phase 3: Maybe look at retention
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Acquiring users you can't retain is waste
- Retention is a multiplier on all acquisition
- 10% retention improvement > 10% acquisition improvement
- Acquisition costs money; retention makes money
- Late retention focus means years of lost users

**The Fix:**
```
The Retention Math:

Scenario A: Focus on acquisition
- 10,000 users acquired
- 20% retained
- 2,000 active users

Scenario B: Focus on retention first
- 8,000 users acquired (less budget)
- 40% retained (fixed retention)
- 3,200 active users

Better outcome with LESS acquisition.

Priority Order:
1. Retention (fix the bucket)
2. Activation (fill it efficiently)
3. Acquisition (scale what works)

Build retention team BEFORE scaling acquisition.
```

---

## 10. The "Free Will Convert" Fallacy

**The Mistake:**
```
Strategy: "Get as many free users as possible"

Theory:
- Free users will eventually convert
- Big numbers impress investors
- Monetization comes later

Reality:
- Free users expect free forever
- Large free base creates support burden
- Converts at 0.5%, need 200 free for 1 paid
- Free users ≠ potential paying users
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Users attracted by "free" are different population
- Free trains users to expect free
- Free users may never have budget/authority to pay
- Large free user base is liability, not asset
- Delayed monetization means unknown unit economics

**The Fix:**
```
Freemium vs Free Strategy:

Freemium (Good):
- Free tier is intentionally limited
- Clear value in paid tier
- Free users WANT to upgrade
- Conversion path is obvious
- Free tier qualifies leads

Free-for-now (Bad):
- "We'll figure out pricing later"
- No conversion mechanism
- Free users are just... free
- Monetization is bolt-on afterthought

Test willingness to pay EARLY:
- Charge from day 1, even if small
- Free trial (limited time) not free tier (forever)
- Ask free users: "Would you pay for X?"
- Watch behavior, not just survey responses
```

## 11. The Growth Hack Lottery

**The Mistake:**
```
Growth team standup:

"Let's try this TikTok thing I saw"
"What about an AI feature?"
"Competitor did a viral campaign"
"I read about this growth hack..."

→ Random experiments with no framework
→ Hope something "goes viral"
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Growth hacks are lottery tickets
- No systematic learning or compounding
- Requires constant new ideas
- Team exhausted chasing trends
- Nothing builds on previous work

**The Fix:**
```
Growth System vs Growth Hacks:

Hack: "Viral video might get us users"
System: "Every user action creates discoverable content"

Hack: "Referral bonus might work"
System: "Product requires sharing to function"

Hack: "PR might get us coverage"
System: "We do remarkable things worth covering"

Build systems that compound:
1. Identify repeatable mechanism
2. Instrument and measure
3. Optimize the system
4. Let it compound

One working system > 100 hacks
```

---

## 12. The "We're Different" Dismissal

**The Mistake:**
```
Advisor: "Your retention is 15%. That's concerning."
Founder: "Our users are different. They use us
         intensely for a period then naturally churn."

Advisor: "Have you tested price increases?"
Founder: "Our market is price-sensitive. That won't work."

Advisor: "What about activation rate?"
Founder: "Our product is complex. Low activation is normal."

[Rationalizing mediocre metrics as acceptable]
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
- "We're different" is usually cope
- Prevents learning from benchmarks and best practices
- Excuses avoid hard work of improvement
- Creates blind spots for real problems
- Competitors without excuses will win

**The Fix:**
```
The "We're Different" Test:

When tempted to say "we're different," ask:

1. Is there ANY successful company in similar space?
   If yes → Study them. You're not that different.

2. Have you actually TESTED the assumption?
   "Our market is price-sensitive" → Did you test prices?
   "Users naturally churn" → Did you try to retain them?

3. Would you accept this from an employee?
   Employee: "My work is different, metrics don't apply"
   You: "That's not acceptable"

   Then why accept it from yourself?

Default: You're not different.
Benchmark metrics apply.
Underperformance needs fixing, not explaining.
```

## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

*Real production issues that cause outages and bugs.*

# Sharp Edges: Growth Strategy

These are the growth mistakes that kill companies or doom them to mediocre outcomes. Each edge represents burned runway, failed experiments, and careers ended by premature scaling.

---

## 1. Growth Before Product-Market Fit

**Severity:** Critical

**The Trap:**
You raise money, hire a growth team, and pour resources into acquisition. Users come in, but churn right out. You're spending faster than you're learning. By the time you realize PMF isn't there, you've burned your runway.

**Why It Happens:**
Investor pressure for growth metrics. "Growth" roles were hired. Vanity metrics show progress. It's easier to blame marketing than question the product. Growth activity feels like progress.

**The Fix:**
Growth amplifies what you have. If you have a leaky bucket, growth fills it faster - and empties it faster. Focus on retention before acquisition. Sean Ellis test: "Would 40%+ of users be very disappointed if they could no longer use the product?" Until yes, don't scale growth.

**Detection Pattern:**
- Month 1 retention below 40% (B2C) or 80% (B2B)
- Cohort curves don't flatten
- CAC increasing while retention flat
- Growth team hired before retention metrics solid
- "We'll improve retention as we scale"

---

## 2. The Paid Acquisition Addiction

**Severity:** Critical

**The Trap:**
Paid acquisition works initially. You scale it. CAC increases as you exhaust early audiences. You're now dependent on paid, but economics don't work. You can't turn it off because growth stops. You're on a treadmill that's speeding up.

**Why It Happens:**
Paid is predictable and controllable. Results are immediate. It feels professional. Organic channels are slow and uncertain. Boards understand "we spent X, got Y users."

**The Fix:**
Paid should be frosting, not the cake. Build organic growth loops first. Use paid to accelerate proven loops, not replace them. Target LTV:CAC of 3:1+ and payback under 12 months. Have a plan to reduce paid as % of acquisition over time.

**Detection Pattern:**
- >70% of acquisition from paid
- CAC trending up quarter over quarter
- No organic growth when paid turned off
- LTV:CAC below 3:1
- Payback period >12 months

---

## 3. The Leaky Bucket Acceleration

**Severity:** Critical

**The Trap:**
You celebrate growing signups while ignoring that activated users and retained users aren't growing at the same rate. Your funnel leaks more than it holds. You're acquiring users just to lose them.

**Why It Happens:**
Acquisition metrics are visible and celebrated. Churn is diffuse and delayed. Nobody gets promoted for "we slowed down churn." Retention requires product work; acquisition requires marketing spend.

**The Fix:**
Fix the bucket before filling it faster. Map your full funnel: Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Revenue → Referral. Find the biggest leak. Fix it before optimizing acquisition. Often the best "growth" work is retention work.

**Detection Pattern:**
- Signup growth >> active user growth
- Activation rate below 30%
- D1/D7/D30 retention declining
- Features launched, retention unchanged
- "More top of funnel" as solution to everything

---

## 4. The Single Channel Dependency

**Severity:** High

**The Trap:**
You find a channel that works - SEO, Facebook ads, partnerships - and double down. It becomes 80%+ of your growth. Then it changes: algorithm update, policy change, market saturation. Your growth collapses.

**Why It Happens:**
Doubling down on what works seems smart. Diversification feels like distraction. The working channel demands resources to optimize. New channels require starting over.

**The Fix:**
No single channel should be >40% of sustainable acquisition. Actively invest in 2-3 channels even when one dominates. Build at least one owned channel (email, community). Every channel saturates or gets disrupted - plan for it.

**Detection Pattern:**
- One channel >50% of acquisition
- Channel concentration increasing
- No active experimentation in new channels
- "We have SEO" as the growth strategy
- Panic when channel performance drops

---

## 5. The Vanity Metrics Celebration

**Severity:** High

**The Trap:**
Dashboards show hockey sticks: downloads, signups, page views, followers. Boards are impressed. But revenue is flat, retention is poor, and engagement is shallow. You're measuring noise, not signal.

**Why It Happens:**
Vanity metrics go up and to the right. They're easy to move. Press releases write themselves. Real metrics are embarrassing or hard to improve.

**The Fix:**
Define your One Metric That Matters (OMTM) - usually weekly active users doing the core action, or monthly retention. Everything else is interesting context, not success. Ask: "If this metric doubled, would the business double?" If not, it's vanity.

**Detection Pattern:**
- Celebrating downloads/signups as wins
- No cohort-based retention analysis
- Revenue not tracking with user metrics
- "Active users" defined loosely
- Metrics gamed for board presentations

---

## 6. The Referral Program Silver Bullet

**Severity:** High

**The Trap:**
"Dropbox grew with referrals, let's add a referral program!" You build it, offer incentives, announce it. Nothing happens. Turns out your product isn't referral-worthy and incentives don't change that.

**Why It Happens:**
Referral success stories are famous. It feels like a growth hack. Easy to build (just add incentives). Avoids facing why users don't refer organically.

**The Fix:**
Referral programs amplify existing referral behavior; they don't create it. If users aren't referring organically, incentives won't help. First question: "Do users tell others about us without incentives?" If no, fix the product. If yes, then referral programs can accelerate.

**Detection Pattern:**
- Referral program launched without organic referral data
- High incentives (desperation sign)
- Low redemption rate
- Referred users churn faster than organic
- "Nobody knows about us" as referral problem

---

## 7. The Growth Hack Obsession

**Severity:** Medium

**The Trap:**
You chase "growth hacks" - viral videos, influencer stunts, gamification tricks. Some work briefly. But nothing compounds. You're constantly searching for the next hack instead of building sustainable systems.

**Why It Happens:**
Growth hack stories are exciting. Quick wins feel good. Systematic work is boring. "10x Growth Hack" articles get clicks.

**The Fix:**
Growth hacks are lottery tickets. Growth systems are retirement accounts. Build loops that compound: user creates content → content gets indexed → search brings users → users create content. Each cycle strengthens the next. Sustainable growth is unsexy but wins.

**Detection Pattern:**
- Growth tactics but no growth strategy
- Success not repeatable
- Constant search for "what's next"
- No compounding over time
- Growth team doing random experiments

---

## 8. The "We'll Figure Out Monetization Later" Trap

**Severity:** High

**The Trap:**
You grow users aggressively, assuming monetization will follow. When you finally introduce pricing, users revolt or churn. Turns out you trained them to expect free, or the users you attracted can't/won't pay.

**Why It Happens:**
Monetization feels like it will slow growth. Investors push user metrics over revenue. "Get users now, monetize later" worked for some (survivorship bias). Free products grow faster initially.

**The Fix:**
Build monetization into growth strategy from the start. Know who will pay and why. Ideally, monetize early to validate willingness to pay. Growth of paying users > growth of free users. Users attracted by "free" are different from users willing to pay.

**Detection Pattern:**
- Metrics focus on users, not revenue
- No paying customer segment defined
- Pricing discussions deferred
- Assumption that users will convert to paid
- "We'll monetize when we hit X users"

---

## 9. The Network Effects Mirage

**Severity:** High

**The Trap:**
You believe you have network effects because more users make the product better. But you don't have true network effects - you have scale effects or content aggregation. When growth slows, there's no self-reinforcing loop.

**Why It Happens:**
"Network effects" sounds good to investors. Confusing supply-side scale with demand-side network effects. Misidentifying content volume as network value.

**The Fix:**
True network effects: each user directly increases value for other users. More friends on Facebook makes Facebook better for you. Test: if you lose 20% of users, does value drop more than 20%? If not, you don't have network effects - you have scale economies.

**Detection Pattern:**
- Claiming network effects without demonstrating them
- Value comes from content, not connections
- Users don't directly interact
- No winner-take-all dynamic
- Competitors easily replicate at scale

---

## 10. The Optimization Trap

**Severity:** Medium

**The Trap:**
You A/B test everything. You optimize every step. Conversion rate goes from 2% to 2.3%. But you're optimizing a fundamentally broken funnel. 10x improvement on the wrong thing is still the wrong thing.

**Why It Happens:**
Optimization feels rigorous and data-driven. Small wins accumulate into big reports. It's safer than questioning fundamentals. Testing is a good excuse to avoid hard product decisions.

**The Fix:**
First, ask if you're solving the right problem. A 10% improvement on acquisition doesn't matter if retention is 10%. Prioritize: 1) Fix broken things, 2) Build missing things, 3) Optimize working things. Most growth comes from category changes, not incremental optimization.

**Detection Pattern:**
- A/B testing everything except strategy
- Tiny incremental wins celebrated
- Fundamental funnel issues ignored
- "Data-driven" as excuse for inaction
- No 10x thinking, only % improvement

---

## 11. The "More Features = More Growth" Fallacy

**Severity:** High

**The Trap:**
Growth stalls, so you build more features. Users now have more to discover but core engagement doesn't improve. Product becomes bloated and confusing. The features that initially drove growth are buried.

**Why It Happens:**
Features feel like progress. Roadmap stays full. "Users asked for this." Engineering wants to build. Removing features is politically hard.

**The Fix:**
Growth usually comes from doubling down on what works, not adding more. Audit: which features drive activation and retention? Which are used by <10% of users? Consider removing complexity. The best growth lever is often simplification, not addition.

**Detection Pattern:**
- Feature count growing, engagement flat
- New features unused after launch
- Onboarding complexity increasing
- Core feature engagement declining
- "Feature X will drive growth" repeatedly fails

---

## 12. The Wrong Audience Acquisition

**Severity:** High

**The Trap:**
Your acquisition is great - lots of signups! But they're the wrong users. They don't have the problem you solve, can't afford your solution, or are tire-kickers. Your top of funnel looks healthy, but nothing converts.

**Why It Happens:**
Volume metrics feel good. Broad targeting is easier. "More is better" mindset. Acquisition and activation teams aren't aligned.

**The Fix:**
Define your ideal customer profile (ICP) with extreme specificity. Measure acquisition quality, not just quantity. Track activation rate by acquisition source. Cut channels that bring low-quality users even if CPL looks good.

**Detection Pattern:**
- High acquisition, low activation
- Activation varies wildly by source
- Sales team says "leads are bad"
- High support volume from new users
- Users don't have problem you solve

## Decision Framework

# Decisions: Growth Strategy

Critical decision points that determine growth strategy success.

---

## Decision 1: Product-Led vs Sales-Led Growth

**Context:** When determining your primary growth motion.

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| **Product-Led (PLG)** | Low CAC, scalable, users self-qualify | Requires great UX, slow enterprise, support burden | Self-serve product, low price point, easy to try |
| **Sales-Led** | High deal values, relationships, complex sales | High CAC, headcount dependency, slow to scale | Enterprise target, complex product, >$20K deals |
| **Hybrid** | Best of both, multiple paths | Complex operations, potential conflict | Mid-market, land-and-expand strategy |

**Framework:**
```
Product Complexity vs Deal Size:

                    High Complexity
                          │
           Sales-Led      │      Hybrid
           (Salesforce)   │      (Slack)
                          │
    ──────────────────────┼──────────────────────
                          │
           Hybrid         │      Product-Led
           (Zoom)         │      (Canva)
                          │
                    Low Complexity

    Low Price ───────────────────────── High Price

Decision questions:
1. Can users get value without talking to anyone?
2. Is purchase decision individual or committee?
3. What's your average deal size?
4. How long is the consideration period?
```

**Default Recommendation:** Start product-led if possible. PLG builds compounding acquisition and is more capital efficient. Add sales to capture enterprise once self-serve is working.

---

## Decision 2: Acquisition Channel Focus

**Context:** When choosing which growth channels to invest in.

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| **Paid Acquisition** | Predictable, immediate, scalable | Expensive, no moat, diminishing returns | Proven unit economics, funding available, testing PMF |
| **Organic/SEO** | Compounds, defensible, free traffic | Slow (6-18 months), requires content | Users search for solutions, long-term horizon |
| **Viral/Referral** | Free acquisition, best CAC | Requires product fit, unpredictable | Product is inherently shareable |
| **Partnerships** | Access to audiences, credibility | Slow, dependent on others | Complementary products, enterprise market |

**Framework:**
```
The Bullseye Framework:

Outer Ring (Brainstorm all 19 channels):
Viral, PR, SEO, Content, Paid, Email, Sales,
Community, Partnerships, Events, Engineering,
Affiliate, Platforms, Trade shows, Speaking,
Offline ads, Influencers, Business dev, Licensing

Middle Ring (Test top 6):
Score each: Potential × Fit × Cost-to-test
Run $500-2K tests on top 6

Inner Ring (Double down on 1-2):
Find the ONE that works
Exhaust it before diversifying

Most growth comes from ONE channel.
```

**Default Recommendation:** Test multiple, commit to one. Spreading resources across many channels means none work well. Find your channel, then scale it.

---

## Decision 3: Free Tier vs Free Trial

**Context:** When designing your freemium strategy.

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| **Free Forever Tier** | Low friction, viral potential, large base | Support costs, conversion challenge | Network effects, viral product, land-and-expand |
| **Free Trial (Time-limited)** | Creates urgency, qualifies buyers, clear path | Higher friction, smaller top of funnel | High-value product, clear value delivery |
| **Free Trial (Usage-limited)** | Value-based, scales with success | Complex to manage, may feel punitive | Consumption-based pricing, measurable value |
| **No Free** | Qualifies buyers, simpler ops | Smallest funnel, higher friction | Premium positioning, complex sales |

**Framework:**
```
Free Tier Decision Tree:

Does your product have network effects?
├── Yes → Free tier helps build network
│         (Slack, LinkedIn)
└── No → Continue

Is virality built into product usage?
├── Yes → Free tier enables sharing
│         (Calendly, Loom)
└── No → Continue

Can you deliver value quickly?
├── Yes → Free trial works
│         (14-day trial with clear value)
└── No → Consider demo/sales motion

Free tier metrics to watch:
- Free-to-paid conversion rate (>2% is good)
- Time to upgrade (shorter is better)
- Free user support cost
- Viral coefficient of free users
```

**Default Recommendation:** Free trial over free tier unless you have viral/network mechanics. Free tiers are expensive and rarely convert without explicit viral value.

---

## Decision 4: When to Scale Acquisition

**Context:** When deciding if you're ready to scale growth investment.

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| **Scale Now** | Capture market, hit targets, show growth | May burn money on broken funnel | Proven retention, unit economics work, clear channel |
| **Fix First** | Efficient use of capital, sustainable | May miss window, slower growth | Retention poor, economics don't work, funnel leaks |
| **Test and Scale** | Balanced approach | Complexity, slower than full scale | Some metrics good, others unknown |

**Framework:**
```
Scale Readiness Scorecard:

Retention Score (must pass):
□ D1 retention > 40% (consumer) or > 85% (B2B)
□ Month 3+ retention > 20% (consumer) or > 80% (B2B)
□ Cohort curves flatten (not declining to zero)

Unit Economics (must pass):
□ LTV:CAC > 3:1
□ Payback period < 12 months
□ Gross margin > 60%

Channel Proof (nice to have):
□ CAC stable as you 3x spend
□ Channel has headroom (not saturated)
□ Repeatable process documented

Scoring:
- All retention + economics pass → Scale
- Any retention fails → Fix retention first
- Economics fail → Fix pricing/efficiency first
- Channel unclear → Test channel first
```

**Default Recommendation:** Fix retention before scaling. Every dollar spent acquiring users who churn is wasted. Retention first, always.

---

## Decision 5: Horizontal vs Vertical Expansion

**Context:** When planning how to grow your market.

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| **Horizontal (new segments)** | Larger TAM, diversified | Diluted positioning, spread thin | Dominant in current segment, clear adjacent need |
| **Vertical (deeper in segment)** | Strong positioning, efficient | Ceiling risk, segment dependency | Not yet dominant, segment has depth |
| **Geographic** | Market expansion, growth | Localization costs, ops complexity | Strong in home market, international demand |
| **Product Expansion** | Increase LTV, stickiness | Complexity, distraction | Core product mature, clear customer request |

**Framework:**
```
Expansion Readiness:

Before expanding horizontally, ask:
1. Are we #1 or #2 in current segment?
   No → Stay focused
2. Is current segment fully penetrated?
   No → Grow current first
3. Is there natural pull from adjacent segment?
   No → Expansion will be hard

Before product expansion, ask:
1. Are customers ASKING for new product?
   No → Don't build it
2. Is it natural extension of current value?
   No → May confuse positioning
3. Will it increase retention/LTV significantly?
   No → Not worth complexity

Sequence:
Vertical depth → Product expansion → Horizontal segments → Geographic
```

**Default Recommendation:** Go vertical first. Dominance in one segment beats mediocrity in many. Expand only after dominance, not to escape a losing position.

---

## Decision 6: Referral Program Design

**Context:** When designing incentive structure for referrals.

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| **Two-sided (both get reward)** | Fair, encouraged sharing | More expensive, complex | High LTV supports cost, B2C products |
| **Referrer only** | Cheaper, simpler | Feels spammy, less compelling | Cost-sensitive, existing demand |
| **Referred only** | Feels generous, good impression | Less incentive for referrer | Strong organic referral exists, brand-focused |
| **Non-monetary** | Cheap, on-brand | Less motivating for some | Community-driven product, premium brand |

**Framework:**
```
Referral Program Prerequisites:

Before building referral program:
□ Do users refer WITHOUT incentives?
  No → Incentives won't help. Fix product.

□ What's the organic referral rate?
  Baseline: ___ referrals per 100 users
  (If near zero, incentives won't fix it)

□ Why do current referrers refer?
  Understand motivation before adding incentives

Incentive Design:
- Value should be 10-20% of LTV (affordable)
- Reward should match product (credits > cash)
- Timing: instant for referred, delayed for referrer
- Double-sided usually outperforms single-sided

Measure:
- Viral coefficient: K = invites × conversion
- K > 1 = viral growth
- K > 0.5 = meaningful contribution
- K < 0.3 = not working
```

**Default Recommendation:** Two-sided rewards with product credits. Only launch after proving organic referral exists. Incentives amplify behavior; they don't create it.

---

## Decision 7: Pricing Model Selection

**Context:** When designing how to capture value.

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| **Flat subscription** | Simple, predictable revenue | May leave money on table, low price anchor | Simple product, individual users |
| **Usage-based** | Scales with value, low barrier | Revenue volatility, harder to predict | Variable value delivery, API/infrastructure |
| **Per-seat** | Natural expansion, clear metric | Discourages adoption, gaming | Collaboration tools, team products |
| **Tiered** | Segmented capture, upgrade path | Complexity, feature gating decisions | Diverse customer segments, feature depth |

**Framework:**
```
Pricing Model Decision Tree:

Does value scale with usage?
├── Yes (API, storage, messages)
│   → Usage-based component
└── No → Continue

Does value scale with team size?
├── Yes (collaboration, communication)
│   → Per-seat component
└── No → Continue

Do you have distinct customer segments?
├── Yes (SMB, mid-market, enterprise)
│   → Tiered pricing
└── No → Flat subscription

Hybrid is often best:
- Base subscription + usage = predictable + scalable
- Per-seat with tier caps = expansion + segmentation
- Tier + usage = segmentation + value capture

The goal: Pricing that grows with customer success.
```

**Default Recommendation:** Start simple, add complexity as you learn. Flat subscription gets you started; optimize pricing model after you have data on how customers get value.

---

## Decision 8: Growth Team Structure

**Context:** When building your growth organization.

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| **Centralized Growth Team** | Focused, specialized, clear ownership | Siloed, may lack product context | Growth is distinct discipline, clear scope |
| **Embedded in Product** | Product context, integrated | No dedicated focus, deprioritized | Product IS growth, early stage |
| **Growth Pods** | Best of both, cross-functional | Coordination overhead, complexity | Scale, multiple growth bets |
| **CEO-Owned** | Ultimate priority, no politics | CEO bandwidth, no specialization | Early stage, pre-PMF |

**Framework:**
```
Growth Organization Evolution:

Stage 1 (Pre-PMF):
CEO + one growth-minded person
Focus: Retention, activation
Don't scale acquisition yet

Stage 2 (Early Growth):
Small growth team (2-5)
PM + Engineer + Designer + Data
Focus: Growth loops, channel testing
Still embedded with product

Stage 3 (Scaling):
Growth pods by lever
- Acquisition pod
- Activation pod
- Monetization pod
Each: PM + Eng + Design + Data
Focus: Optimize each stage

Stage 4 (Mature):
Centralized strategy + embedded execution
Growth leadership sets strategy
Growth engineers on product teams
Focus: Compounding growth systems

Key principle: Growth needs engineering.
If growth can't change the product, it fails.
```

**Default Recommendation:** Start embedded, separate later. Growth that can't ship product changes is just marketing. Embed growth in product until you have dedicated engineering capacity.

---

## Decision 9: International Expansion Timing

**Context:** When considering geographic growth.

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| **Global from Day 1** | First mover advantage, larger market | Resource spread, localization debt | Digital product, English-first works globally |
| **Dominate Home First** | Focus, proven model, efficiency | May miss markets, slower total growth | Local market large enough, model unproven |
| **Follow Demand** | Organic pull, lower risk | Reactive, may miss opportunities | Strong organic international signal |
| **Strategic Market Entry** | Planned, resourced properly | Slow, high investment | Clear strategic markets, resources available |

**Framework:**
```
International Expansion Checklist:

Prerequisites:
□ Dominant position in home market? (or clear ceiling)
□ Product-market fit proven?
□ Unit economics work?
□ Organic international demand exists?

Market Selection Criteria:
1. Market size and growth
2. Competition landscape
3. Localization complexity (language, payments, legal)
4. Cultural product fit
5. Existing organic traction

Entry Approach:
Low localization (digital, English): Launch and see
Medium localization: Local marketing, support
High localization: Local team, product changes

Common mistake: Expanding to escape home market problems.
International amplifies success, doesn't create it.
```

**Default Recommendation:** Follow organic demand. If you're seeing signups/usage from a region, lean in. Proactive expansion without demand signal is expensive.

---

## Decision 10: Growth Metric North Star

**Context:** When choosing the metric that drives growth focus.

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| **Weekly Active Users** | Clear, engagement-focused | May miss monetization | Consumer, engagement-driven |
| **Monthly Recurring Revenue** | Revenue-focused, clear value | May optimize for extraction | B2B SaaS, subscription business |
| **Activated Users** | Quality over quantity | May under-invest in acquisition | Activation is bottleneck, new product |
| **Retained Cohort %** | Health-focused, sustainable | Harder to communicate, slower | Retention is broken, needs fixing |

**Framework:**
```
North Star Selection:

The North Star must:
1. Reflect customer value (not vanity)
2. Correlate with business success
3. Be actionable by the team
4. Be measurable in real-time

North Star Candidates:

Consumer products:
- Weekly Active Users (WAU)
- Time spent in app
- Core actions taken

B2B SaaS:
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
- Active accounts (by tier)

Marketplaces:
- Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)
- Transactions completed
- Active buyers AND sellers

Test: "If this metric doubled, would the business
      clearly be twice as successful?"

If no, it's not your North Star.
```

**Default Recommendation:** Choose ONE metric, communicate relentlessly. Different teams with different metrics creates chaos. One North Star aligns everyone.

---

## Decision 11: Organic vs Paid Mix

**Context:** When allocating resources between organic and paid growth.

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| **Paid-Heavy (70%+)** | Fast, predictable, controllable | Expensive, no moat, treadmill | Testing PMF, time-sensitive, funded |
| **Organic-Heavy (70%+)** | Sustainable, compounds, defensible | Slow, unpredictable | Long runway, strong content/viral fit |
| **Balanced (50/50)** | Diversified, flexible | Neither optimized | Transitioning, testing both |
| **Shift Over Time** | Strategic evolution | Requires planning, discipline | Building sustainable engine |

**Framework:**
```
Healthy Mix Evolution:

Early Stage (Pre-PMF):
- 80% organic (scrappy, testing)
- 20% paid (small tests only)
Why: Learning, not scaling

Growth Stage (PMF-found):
- 50% paid (proven unit economics)
- 50% organic (building moat)
Why: Scale what works, build sustainability

Scale Stage (Market leader):
- 30% paid (marginal growth)
- 70% organic (compounding moat)
Why: Moat matters more than marginal growth

Warning Signs:
- Paid > 80%: "Growth stops when spending stops"
- No organic working: Vulnerable to CAC inflation
- Only organic: May be leaving growth on table

The goal: Paid buys time while organic compounds.
```

**Default Recommendation:** Build organic first, amplify with paid. Paid should accelerate working organic loops, not replace them. If organic doesn't work, paid won't save you.

## Decision 12: Build vs Buy for Growth Tools

**Context:** When deciding how to get growth infrastructure.

**Options:**

| Option | Pros | Cons | Choose When |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| **Buy (SaaS tools)** | Fast, maintained, battle-tested | Cost, dependency, generic | Speed matters, commodity capability |
| **Build Custom** | Tailored, owned, competitive advantage | Time, maintenance, expertise | Differentiated need, core to strategy |
| **Build on OSS** | Flexible, owned, cheaper | Maintenance, integration work | Technical team, cost-sensitive |

**Framework:**
```
Build vs Buy for Growth Stack:

Almost always buy:
- Email/messaging (Sendgrid, Customer.io)
- Analytics (Amplitude, Mixpanel)
- A/B testing (LaunchDarkly, Optimizely)
- Attribution (Segment, AppsFlyer)
- CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce)

Consider building:
- Referral systems (if core to growth)
- Custom onboarding (if differentiated)
- Engagement mechanics (if competitive advantage)
- Growth algorithms (if unique logic)

Decision criteria:
1. Is this a competitive advantage?
   Yes → Consider building
   No → Buy

2. Does off-the-shelf meet 80% of needs?
   Yes → Buy
   No → Build or heavily customize

3. Do you have engineering capacity?
   No → Buy
   Yes → Evaluate build

Growth team time is the scarcest resource.
Buy commodity, build competitive advantage.
```

**Default Recommendation:** Buy almost everything. Growth engineering time should go to product changes that drive growth, not infrastructure that exists as SaaS.
