## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

*Real production issues that cause outages and bugs.*

### [CRITICAL] Audit evidence stored in mutable storage undermines integrity

**Why it happens:**
Compliance evidence must be immutable to prove it wasn't altered after
collection. If evidence can be modified, its value is zero - auditors
can't trust it, and you can't prove your controls were working.


**Solution:**
```
1. Immutable storage:
   - S3 Object Lock (GOVERNANCE or COMPLIANCE mode)
   - Azure Immutable Blob Storage
   - Write-once storage

2. Integrity verification:
   - SHA-256 hash at collection
   - Hash stored separately
   - Verify before audit

3. Chain of custody:
   - Log all access
   - Timestamp with trusted time source
   - Digital signatures

```

**Symptoms:**
- Evidence files can be edited
- No hash verification
- Auditor questions evidence authenticity

### [HIGH] Policy-as-code hasn't been updated as infrastructure evolved

**Why it happens:**
Infrastructure changes constantly - new services, renamed resources,
changed configurations. If policies aren't updated, they silently
stop checking what matters. You think you're compliant, but you're not.


**Solution:**
```
1. Policy CI/CD:
   - Policies version-controlled
   - Review policies on infrastructure changes
   - Automated policy testing

2. Coverage monitoring:
   - Track resource types vs policy coverage
   - Alert on new uncovered resources
   - Require policies before production

3. Regular audits:
   - Quarterly policy review
   - Compare against infrastructure inventory
   - Update policies proactively

```

**Symptoms:**
- New resources not covered by policies
- Policies reference deprecated configurations
- False negatives in compliance checks

---

### [HIGH] Violations are detected but nothing happens

**Why it happens:**
Compliance monitoring is useless if violations aren't addressed.
If you detect problems but don't fix them, you're just documenting
your non-compliance - which is worse than not knowing.


**Solution:**
```
1. Automated remediation:
   - Auto-fix low-risk violations
   - Auto-create tickets for others
   - SLA for remediation

2. Enforcement:
   - Block non-compliant deployments
   - Require exception approval
   - Time-bound exceptions only

3. Accountability:
   - Violations assigned to owners
   - Escalation for overdue items
   - Executive visibility

```

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard shows failures
- No remediation workflow
- Same violations for months

---

### [MEDIUM] Evidence collection is a last-minute fire drill

**Why it happens:**
If you're only collecting evidence before audits, you're proving you
can scramble under pressure - not that your controls work year-round.
Continuous compliance means the audit is just a review of existing data.


**Solution:**
```
1. Continuous evidence collection:
   - Automated daily/weekly collection
   - Stored with retention policies
   - Never delete before audit

2. Always audit-ready:
   - Evidence available instantly
   - Dashboards show current state
   - No special prep needed

3. Process discipline:
   - Document process changes immediately
   - Evidence generated as side effect
   - Real-time compliance visibility

```

**Symptoms:**
- Weeks of audit prep
- Missing evidence scramble
- Evidence created retroactively

## Collaboration

### When to Hand Off

| Trigger | Delegate To | Context |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `gdpr|privacy|pii|data.protection` | gdpr-privacy | Privacy-specific compliance |
| `sox|itgc|financial.controls|sarbanes` | sox-compliance | Financial compliance |
| `data.governance|data.quality` | data-governance | Data governance compliance |

### Receives Work From

- **gdpr-privacy**: Privacy compliance requirements
- **sox-compliance**: Financial compliance requirements
