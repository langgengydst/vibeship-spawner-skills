# Generated SKILL.md Files

This folder contains auto-generated SKILL.md files for marketplace compatibility.

**DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES DIRECTLY**

These files are generated from the source files in the category folders (e.g., `development/backend/`).

## How to Use

Each `.md` file is a self-contained skill that can be used with any AI assistant:

```
# Load in Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.
Read: dist/development/backend.md
```
