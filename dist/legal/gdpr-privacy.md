## Patterns


## Anti-Patterns


## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

*Real production issues that cause outages and bugs.*

### [CRITICAL] Consent is invalid if there's a power imbalance or no real choice

**Why it happens:**
GDPR requires consent to be freely given. If data subjects have no
genuine choice or face negative consequences for refusing, consent
is invalid. This is especially problematic in employment contexts
where employees can't refuse employer requests.


**Solution:**
```
1. Use appropriate legal basis instead:
   - Employment context: Contract or legal obligation
   - Marketing: Legitimate interests with opt-out
   - Essential processing: Contract performance

2. If consent is required:
   - Ensure genuine choice exists
   - No penalty for refusing
   - Easy to withdraw

```

**Symptoms:**
- Employee consent for employment data
- Service denied without consent
- No alternative to consenting

### [CRITICAL] Failure to notify supervisory authority within 72 hours

**Why it happens:**
GDPR requires notification to supervisory authority within 72 hours
of becoming aware of a breach that poses risk to individuals. Waiting
for complete investigation is not an excuse. Notification can be
provided in phases.


**Solution:**
```
1. Immediate breach logging:
   - Timestamp of detection
   - Initial assessment

2. 72-hour decision framework:
   - Risk assessment within 24 hours
   - Notification decision within 48 hours
   - Submit notification or document why not required

3. Phased notification:
   "We are aware of a breach affecting approximately X users.
    Investigation ongoing. Updates to follow."

```

**Symptoms:**
- Breach detected but not logged
- No clear breach assessment process
- Waiting for 'full investigation'

### [HIGH] High-risk processing without proper Data Protection Impact Assessment

**Why it happens:**
GDPR Article 35 requires DPIA before high-risk processing. Without it,
you can't demonstrate compliance and may miss significant privacy risks.
The EDPB has defined 9 criteria - meeting 2 or more triggers DPIA requirement.


**Solution:**
```
DPIA required when 2+ criteria met:
1. Evaluation/scoring
2. Automated decision-making with legal effects
3. Systematic monitoring
4. Sensitive data or vulnerable subjects
5. Large scale processing
6. Matching/combining datasets
7. Innovative technology
8. Preventing data subjects from exercising rights
9. Data transfers outside EU

Conduct DPIA before processing begins.

```

**Symptoms:**
- New technology processing personal data
- Large-scale processing of sensitive data
- Systematic monitoring of public areas
- No DPIA documentation

### [HIGH] Transferring data outside EU without valid mechanism

**Why it happens:**
Post-Schrems II, transfers to countries without adequacy decisions
require Standard Contractual Clauses plus supplementary measures.
Simply using SCCs may not be enough if destination country law
undermines protections.


**Solution:**
```
1. Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA):
   - Assess destination country law
   - Document surveillance risks
   - Identify supplementary measures

2. Supplementary measures:
   - End-to-end encryption (customer-held keys)
   - Pseudonymization before transfer
   - Contractual commitments not to comply with access requests

3. Consider EU-based alternatives when possible

```

**Symptoms:**
- Using US cloud providers
- Offshore development team access
- No SCCs or adequacy decision

## Collaboration

### When to Hand Off

| Trigger | Delegate To | Context |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `contract|vendor|dpa|agreement` | contract-analysis | Data processing agreements |
| `audit|sox|controls` | sox-compliance | Compliance audit requirements |
| `export|transfer|international` | export-control | International data transfers |

### Receives Work From

- **contract-analysis**: Data processing agreements
- **sox-compliance**: Audit and control requirements
