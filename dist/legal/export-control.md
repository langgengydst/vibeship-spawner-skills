## Sharp Edges (Gotchas)

*Real production issues that cause outages and bugs.*

### [CRITICAL] ITAR data stored on servers outside US or accessed by foreign persons

**Why it happens:**
ITAR prohibits export of defense articles and technical data to
foreign persons or countries without license. Cloud storage outside
US or access by foreign cloud personnel constitutes export. This
can result in criminal penalties and debarment.


**Solution:**
```
1. Use ITAR-compliant cloud:
   - AWS GovCloud (US persons only)
   - Azure Government
   - On-premise with controlled access

2. Data location controls:
   - Restrict to US regions only
   - Disable replication to foreign regions
   - Verify physical server location

3. Access controls:
   - US persons only for admin access
   - Verify citizenship of cloud personnel
   - Contractual commitments from provider

```

**Symptoms:**
- Using cloud provider without ITAR compliance
- Data replicated to foreign regions
- Foreign nationals have admin access

### [CRITICAL] Foreign national employees accessing controlled technology

**Why it happens:**
"Deemed export" treats release to foreign national in the US as
export to their home country. Many engineering teams unknowingly
violate by giving foreign nationals access to controlled source
code, designs, or specifications.


**Solution:**
```
1. Determine US person status:
   - Citizens (by birth or naturalization)
   - Permanent residents (green card)
   - Protected persons (asylum, refugee)
   NOT: H-1B, L-1, F-1, B-1, etc.

2. Technology Control Plan:
   - Identify controlled items
   - Map to foreign national access
   - Implement access controls
   - Obtain licenses if needed

3. Practical controls:
   - Separate repositories
   - Access-controlled networks
   - Badging for restricted areas

```

**Symptoms:**
- Engineers from embargoed countries on team
- No license for foreign national access
- Shared development environment

### [HIGH] Claiming encryption exemption for software that doesn't qualify

**Why it happens:**
Encryption software often qualifies for License Exception ENC,
but the requirements are specific. Mass market encryption has
different rules than custom implementations. Misclassification
can result in export violations.


**Solution:**
```
1. Proper classification:
   - Submit for ECCN classification
   - Get BIS commodity classification
   - Document encryption functionality

2. License Exception ENC requirements:
   - Mass market (retail) exception
   - Or submit encryption registration
   - Annual self-classification report

3. Country restrictions:
   - Even with ENC, some countries restricted
   - E:1 and E:2 countries have limits
   - Verify destination before export

```

**Symptoms:**
- Exporting encryption software as EAR99
- No ENC classification review
- Custom cryptographic implementation

### [HIGH] Not screening all parties in transaction chain

**Why it happens:**
Export regulations require screening all parties: customer,
intermediaries, end users, and involved individuals. Failure
to screen any party can result in violation even if the direct
customer is clean.


**Solution:**
```
1. Screen all parties:
   - Buyer/customer
   - Intermediary/distributor
   - End user
   - Consignee
   - Named individuals

2. Multiple lists:
   - Denied Persons List
   - Entity List
   - SDN List
   - Unverified List
   - ITAR Debarred

3. Ongoing screening:
   - Screen at order entry
   - Re-screen at shipment
   - Screen against list updates

```

**Symptoms:**
- Only screening direct customer
- Not screening intermediaries
- Missing list updates
