  # OUTREACH GOTCHAS
  # =============================================================================

  - id: domain-reputation-death
    summary: "Cold email can destroy your domain reputation permanently"
    severity: critical
    tools_affected: [apollo, instantly, lemlist, outreach]
    situation: "Sending cold emails from main company domain"
    why: |
      If your main domain gets blacklisted:
      - All company email goes to spam
      - Very hard to recover (months)
      - Affects customer communication too
      - Some blacklists are permanent

      This is the #1 cold email mistake.
    solution: |
      1. NEVER use main domain for cold outreach
      2. Buy separate domains (variant names)
      3. Warm up domains for 2-3 weeks before sending
      4. Monitor deliverability metrics
      5. Use dedicated cold email infrastructure

      ```
      # Bad:
      john@company.com sending cold

      # Good:
      john@trycompany.io (separate, warmed domain)
      ```
    symptoms:
      - "Reply rates suddenly drop"
      - "Emails bouncing"
      - "Marketing emails going to spam"

  - id: spam-trap-lists
    summary: "Purchased lists often contain spam traps"
    severity: high
    tools_affected: [apollo, zoominfo, lusha, cognism]
    situation: "Buying or scraping email lists and blasting them"
    why: |
      ESP providers and anti-spam companies plant fake emails:
      - Spam traps look like real addresses
      - Hitting them = instant blacklist
      - No legit person would email these
      - Even big data providers have some

      One spam trap can end your outreach program.
    solution: |
      1. Always verify emails before sending
      2. Use verification tools (NeverBounce, ZeroBounce)
      3. Start with small test sends
      4. Remove bounces immediately
      5. Don't email anyone who hasn't engaged in 6+ months
    symptoms:
      - "Sudden blacklisting"
      - "ESP account suspended"
      - "Deliverability crashes overnight"

  - id: linkedin-automation-ban
    summary: "LinkedIn aggressively bans automation"
    severity: high
    tools_affected: [apollo, lemlist, phantombuster]
    situation: "Using LinkedIn automation at scale"
    why: |
      LinkedIn detects and bans automation:
      - Browser fingerprinting
      - Activity pattern detection
      - API monitoring
      - Connection request limits

      Losing your LinkedIn profile = losing your network.
    solution: |
      1. Stay under daily limits (20-30 connections/day)
      2. Use tools that mimic human behavior
      3. Randomize activity patterns
      4. Don't run automation 24/7
      5. Use Sales Navigator for higher limits
      6. Consider LinkedIn premium accounts
    symptoms:
      - "Connection requests restricted"
      - "Account temporarily suspended"
      - "Profile banned permanently"

  # =============================================================================
  # DATA QUALITY GOTCHAS
  # =============================================================================

  - id: data-decay
    summary: "B2B data decays 30-40% per year"
    severity: high
    tools_affected: [zoominfo, apollo, lusha, clearbit]
    situation: "Treating data as accurate without verification"
    why: |
      People change jobs constantly:
      - 30-40% of B2B data stale within a year
      - Direct dials change even faster
      - Company data (size, tech) changes
      - Even "fresh" data can be months old

      Sending to bad data = bounces = reputation damage.
    solution: |
      1. Verify emails before major campaigns
      2. Look for job change signals
      3. Re-verify data older than 3-6 months
      4. Use waterfall enrichment (multiple sources)
      5. Remove bounces immediately
    symptoms:
      - "High bounce rates (>3%)"
      - "Wrong person replies"
      - "Job titles don't match"

  - id: enrichment-credit-explosion
    summary: "Enrichment credits can burn faster than expected"
    severity: medium
    tools_affected: [clay, clearbit, zoominfo]
    situation: "Running enrichment on large lists without budgeting"
    why: |
      Credits add up quickly:
      - Each enrichment field = credits
      - Waterfall tries multiple sources
      - Re-enrichment doubles cost
      - "Just checking" burns credits too

      Easy to 10x your expected spend.
    solution: |
      1. Budget credits per campaign upfront
      2. Pre-filter lists before enrichment
      3. Only enrich fields you actually use
      4. Set up credit alerts at 50%, 75%
      5. Audit credit usage weekly
    symptoms:
      - "Hit credit limit mid-month"
      - "Unexpected overage charges"
      - "Can't enrich at end of month"

  # =============================================================================
  # CRM GOTCHAS
  # =============================================================================

  - id: crm-data-quality-garbage
    summary: "Bad CRM data makes AI useless"
    severity: high
    tools_affected: [salesforce, hubspot-sales, gong, clari]
    situation: "Expecting AI insights from messy CRM"
    why: |
      AI tools rely on CRM data:
      - Forecasting needs accurate stages
      - Scoring needs consistent properties
      - Analytics needs complete records
      - Garbage in = garbage out

      AI can't fix fundamental data problems.
    solution: |
      1. Establish data entry standards
      2. Use required fields at stage changes
      3. Audit data quality monthly
      4. Auto-populate from reliable sources
      5. Clean duplicates regularly
      6. Train team on data hygiene
    symptoms:
      - "AI predictions wildly wrong"
      - "Can't trust dashboards"
      - "Duplicate records everywhere"

  - id: salesforce-admin-dependency
    summary: "Salesforce becomes a black box without admin"
    severity: high
    tools_affected: [salesforce]
    situation: "Implementing Salesforce without dedicated admin"
    why: |
      Salesforce is infinitely configurable:
      - Custom objects, fields, automations
      - Complex permission structures
      - Integrations break without maintenance
      - Tribal knowledge accumulates

      When your "Salesforce person" leaves, chaos ensues.
    solution: |
      1. Document all customizations
      2. Have backup admin knowledge
      3. Consider managed services
      4. Keep customization minimal
      5. Use standard objects when possible
      6. Regular admin training
    symptoms:
      - "Nobody knows how it works"
      - "Integrations randomly break"
      - "Can't change workflows"

  # AI ASSISTANT GOTCHAS
  # =============================================================================

  - id: gong-privacy-concerns
    summary: "Call recording raises privacy and legal issues"
    severity: high
    tools_affected: [gong, salesloft, outreach]
    situation: "Recording calls without proper consent"
    why: |
      Recording laws vary:
      - Two-party consent states (California, etc.)
      - GDPR requirements in EU
      - Some countries prohibit entirely
      - Customer pushback

      Violations can mean lawsuits and fines.
    solution: |
      1. Know laws for every jurisdiction you sell into
      2. Get explicit consent on every call
      3. Add to meeting invites/scripts
      4. Allow opt-out gracefully
      5. Consult legal before rollout
    symptoms:
      - "Customer complaints"
      - "Legal threats"
      - "Deals killed by recording"

  - id: ai-email-generic
    summary: "AI-generated emails all sound the same"
    severity: medium
    tools_affected: [lavender, regie-ai, apollo]
    situation: "Using AI email suggestions without editing"
    why: |
      AI email tools train on similar data:
      - Same patterns, phrases, structures
      - Prospects see same AI emails daily
      - Detection skills improving
      - "AI voice" becoming recognizable

      If everyone uses same AI, no one stands out.
    solution: |
      1. Use AI for drafts, not final copy
      2. Inject specific research/personalization
      3. Develop your own voice
      4. Customize AI suggestions heavily
      5. A/B test AI vs human-written
    symptoms:
      - "Low reply rates"
      - "Prospects mention 'AI email'"
      - "Sound like every other SDR"

  - id: conversation-intelligence-overload
    summary: "Too much call data, not enough action"
    severity: medium
    tools_affected: [gong, clari]
    situation: "Having all the insights but not changing behavior"
    why: |
      Gong shows everything:
      - Every call recorded
      - Hundreds of metrics
      - Dozens of talk tracks
      - Weekly report emails

      Information overload leads to paralysis.
    solution: |
      1. Pick 2-3 metrics to focus on
      2. Create clear coaching workflows
      3. Schedule regular review sessions
      4. Connect insights to specific actions
      5. Don't try to boil the ocean
    symptoms:
      - "Gong mostly unused"
      - "No behavior change"
      - "Expensive shelfware"

  # INTEGRATION GOTCHAS
  # =============================================================================

  - id: sync-conflicts
    summary: "Tool sync conflicts corrupt CRM data"
    severity: high
    tools_affected: [apollo, outreach, salesloft, hubspot-sales]
    situation: "Multiple tools writing to same CRM fields"
    why: |
      When multiple tools sync:
      - Race conditions occur
      - Last write wins (may be wrong)
      - Duplicates created
      - Activity attribution breaks

      Hard to diagnose, harder to fix.
    solution: |
      1. Map all integrations before setup
      2. Designate one source of truth per field
      3. Use one-way syncs where possible
      4. Test integrations in sandbox
      5. Monitor for sync errors
    symptoms:
      - "Data randomly changes"
      - "Duplicate records"
      - "Wrong activity attribution"

  - id: sequence-overlap
    summary: "Multiple sequences hit same prospect"
    severity: medium
    tools_affected: [apollo, outreach, salesloft]
    situation: "Same person in multiple sequences from different reps"
    why: |
      Without coordination:
      - Marketing + SDR + AE all emailing
      - Different tools, no visibility
      - Prospect gets 5 emails in a day
      - Looks unprofessional, hurts brand

      Annoys prospects and kills deals.
    solution: |
      1. Use CRM sequence exclusions
      2. Coordinate territory rules
      3. Check before adding to sequence
      4. Single outreach tool if possible
      5. Marketing/sales SLA on timing
    symptoms:
      - "Prospects complain about spam"
      - "Confused messaging"
      - "Angry unsubscribes"
